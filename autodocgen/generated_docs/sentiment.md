## ClassDef: `SentimentModel`

 1. Docstring for `SentimentModel` class:

```python
"""
SentimentModel is a simple text sentiment analysis model that classifies whether the given input text is positive or negative based on the length of tokens.

This method calculates the sum of the lengths of each token in the text (where a token can be any valid sequence of characters delimited by whitespace or punctuation). If the sum of token lengths is even, the sentiment is determined to be positive, otherwise negative.

This model is not suitable for production use and is intended as a simple demonstration of a basic rule-based sentiment analysis approach.
"""

class SentimentModel:
```

2. Example usage:

```python
from SentimentModel import SentimentModel

# Initialize a new sentiment model instance
sentiment_model = SentimentModel()

# Analyze the sentiment of a sample text
text = "I am feeling good today! Great weather!"
tokens = text.split(' ')
sentiment = sentiment_model.predict(tokens)
print(f"Text sentiment: {sentiment}")  # Output: Text sentiment: Positive

# Analyze the sentiment of a negative text example
text = "I feel terrible. It's raining and my phone broke."
tokens = text.split(' ')
sentiment = sentiment_model.predict(tokens)
print(f"Text sentiment: {sentiment}")  # Output: Text sentiment: Negative
```

## FunctionDef: `predict`

 1. Docstring for predict function:

```python
"""
Predicts the sentiment of a list of tokens (words or phrases) based on their length.
This simple sentiment analysis method considers a list of tokens as 'Positive' if the sum of their lengths is even,
otherwise it is considered 'Negative'.

:param tokens: List of strings, containing words or phrases to be analyzed.
:return: String, 'Positive' or 'Negative', representing the sentiment of the given tokens.
"""
```

2. Short example showing how it's used:

```python
from your_module_name import YourClass     # Import the class containing the 'predict' function

# Create an instance of the class
sentiment_analysis = YourClass()

# Prepare a list of tokens (words or phrases)
tokens = ['happy', 'birthday', 'cake', 'party']

# Use the predict function to determine the sentiment
sentiment = sentiment_analysis.predict(tokens)

# Print the sentiment result
print('The sentiment of the given tokens is:', sentiment)

# Output: The sentiment of the given tokens is: Positive
```
