# Documentation for `/content/autodocgen/input_code/testing/main.py`

## FunctionDef: `main`

 1. Here's the docstring for the `main` function:

```python
"""
This module contains the main function that demonstrates the usage of three functions: add_numbers, multiply_numbers, and reverse_string.

The main function performs the following actions:
- Adds two numbers using the add_numbers function.
- Multiplies two numbers using the multiply_numbers function.
- Reverses a string using the reverse_string function.
- Prints the results of the operations.
"""
```

2. Here's a short example showing how it's used:

```python
# Import the main function from the file where it's defined
from your_module_name import main

# Run the main function with example number, multiplier, and string inputs
main()  # Addition Result: 15, Multiplication Result: 12, Reversed String: dlroW olleH
```

Assuming that there are three functions `add_numbers`, `multiply_numbers`, and `reverse_string` defined in the same module as `main`, the calculations performed by these functions in the example above are:

- add_numbers(5, 10)
- multiply_numbers(3, 4)
- reverse_string("Hello World")

You should provide these function definitions according to their logic. A simple example for each of the three functions might look like:

```python
def add_numbers(x, y):
    """
    Adds two numbers and returns the result.
    Args:
        x (int): The first number.
        y (int): The second number.
    Returns:
        The sum of x and y.
    """
    return x + y

def multiply_numbers(x, y):
    """
    Multiplies two numbers and returns the result.
    Args:
        x (int): The first number.
        y (int): The second number.
    Returns:
        The product of x and y.
    """
    return x * y

def reverse_string(s):
    """
    Reverses a given string.
    Args:
        s (str): The input string.
    Returns:
        The reversed string.
    """
    return s[::-1]
```
