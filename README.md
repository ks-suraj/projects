# 🚀 Genesis: An Autonomous AI Research Engineer — From Papers to Production

> *A private automation framework for transforming ML research into runnable prototypes — with minimal human input.*

Genesis is a modular, multi-agent AI system that automates large portions of the ML research workflow.

It is capable of:
- Parsing academic literature
- Designing model structures
- Generating and testing code
- Iteratively refining experiments

Designed for high-level users and private research use cases.

## 🧠 Core Philosophy

Genesis uses a collection of intelligent components to simulate the work of a full-stack ML engineer. The system is designed with modularity, discretion, and offline execution in mind.

**Note:** Detailed implementation of logic is intentionally excluded.

## ⚙️ Setup (For Advanced Users Only)

```
git clone https://github.com/yourname/genesis-ai
cd genesis-ai
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Configure environment variables as needed in `.env`.

---

## ▶️ Usage

```
python run_pipeline.py
```

This command runs the pipeline. For safety and interpretability, each stage is logged. You are expected to audit outputs before deployment.
