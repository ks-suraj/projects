Given your current results of ~47.95% accuracy and loss (~0.52), it appears the model is underfitting or has room for improvement. Here are actionable suggestions to enhance performance through **hyperparameter tuning** and **mutation strategies**:

---

### **Immediate Hyperparameter Tweaks**
1. **Learning Rate**  
   - Your new learning rate is already very low (0.001). While this avoids divergence, it might inhibit learning.  
   - **Next try**: Test a slightly higher learning rate (e.g., `0.0015` to `0.0025`) or use **learning rate scheduling** (e.g., cosine decay, exponential decay).  
     ```json
     "mutation": {
       "mutation_type": "parameter_tweak",
       "new_parameter": "learning_rate_schedule",
       "new_value": "cosine_decay"
     }
     ```

2. **Batch Size**  
   - Smaller batch sizes can improve generalization by introducing noise into gradient estimates. Larger batches might speed up training but could lead to suboptimal solutions.  
   - **Suggestion**: Try decaying the batch size (e.g., from 16 to 32 to 64) across epochs or randomly sample different sizes.  
     ```json
     "mutation": {
       "mutation_type": "parameter_tweak",
       "new_parameter": "batch_size",
       "new_value": 32
     }
     ```

3. **Model Architecture**  
   - A "mutation" to architectural parameters (e.g., number of layers, units, or depth) could improve expressiveness.  
   - **Try**: Increase hidden layer size or depth (e.g., from 256 to 512 units). For CNNs/LSTMs, increase filters/units.  
     ```json
     "mutation": {
       "mutation_type": "architectural_change",
       "new_parameter": "hidden_units",
       "new_value": 512
     }
     ```

4. **Optimizer**  
   - The optimizer choice matters significantly. If using standard SGD, switching to **AdamW** (which combines Adam with weight decay) might help.  
   - **Suggestion**: Add `optimizer: "AdamW"` to your hyperparameters.  
     ```json
     "mutation": {
       "mutation_type": "parameter_tweak",
       "new_parameter": "optimizer",
       "new_value": "AdamW"
     }
     ```

5. **Activation Functions**  
   - Experiment with different activation functions (e.g., replace ReLU with **Swish** or **GELU** in deep layers).  
     ```json
     "mutation": {
       "mutation_type": "parameter_tweak",
       "new_parameter": "activation_function",
       "new_value": "Swish"
     }
     ```

### **Advanced Mutation Strategies**
1. **Multi-Parameter Additive Mutation**  
   Change **multiple hyperparameters simultaneously** (e.g., learning rate, batch size, and optimizer) to explore interactions.  
   - Example:  
     ```json
     "mutation": {
       "mutation_type": "additive",
       "parameters": {
         "learning_rate": 0.002,
         "batch_size": 64,
         "optimizer": "SGD"
       }
     }
     ```

2. **Layer or Node Addition**  
   Increase model capacity by adding a layer (e.g., a dense layer in MLPs) or more nodes in existing layers.  
   - Example:  
     ```json
     "mutation": {
       "mutation_type": "architectural_change",
       "new_parameter": "add_layer",
       "new_value": "Dense(512, activation='gelu')"
     }
     ```

3. **Data Augmentation**  
   Introduce augmentations to artificially diversify training data (e.g., image rotations, flips, or text shuffling).  
   - Example (for image data):  
     ```json
     "mutation": {
       "mutation_type": "augmentation",
       "new_parameter": "augmentations",
       "new_value": "rotation_range=10, horizontal_flip=True"
     }
     ```

4. **Regularization**  
   Reduce overfitting with dropout or weight decay. Start with moderate values (e.g., `0.3` dropout).  
   - Example:  
     ```json
     "mutation": {
       "mutation_type": "architectural_change",
       "new_parameter": "dropout_rate",
       "new_value": 0.3
     }
     ```

5. **Warm Restart Scheduling**  
   Use a learning rate scheduler with **stochastic warm restarts** (e.g., `SGDR`) to escape local minima.  
   - Example:  
     ```json
     "mutation": {
       "mutation_type": "parameter_tweak",
       "new_parameter": "lr_scheduler",
       "new_value": "WarmRestarts"
     }
     ```

### **Systematic Exploration Strategies**
1. **Bayesian Optimization**  
   Use a Bayesian approach (e.g., via `scikit-optimize` or `Optuna`) to efficiently search over hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and weight decay.  
   - Example search space:  
     ```python
     space = {
       "learning_rate": Real(1e-5, 1e-2, prior="log-uniform"),
       "batch_size": [16, 32, 64],
       "num_layers": [2, 3, 4]
     }
     ```

2. **Early Stopping and Model Checkpointing**  
   Since you only trained for 5 epochs, the model might not have converged. Add early stopping and save the best weights.  
   - Example mutation:  
     ```json
     "mutation": {
       "mutation_type": "parameter_tweak",
       "new_parameter": "early_stopping",
       "new_value": {
         "monitor": "val_loss",
         "patience": 10
       }
     }
     ```

3. **Grid Search with Key Parameters**  
   Test combinations of learning rates (`0.0005, 0.001, 0.002`), optimizers (`Adam, SGD, AdamW`), and batch sizes (`16, 32, 64`). Prioritize combinations with **base model performance** (~47.95%) as a benchmark.

4. **Weight Initialization**  
   Use advanced initialization (e.g., **He Normal**/Uniform for ReLU-based networks) to stabilize early training.  
   - Example:  
     ```json
     "mutation": {
       "mutation_type": "parameter_tweak",
       "new_parameter": "initializer",
       "new_value": "HeNormal"
     }
     ```

### **Key Metrics to Monitor**
- **Convergence speed**: 5 epochs is insufficient for most problems. Monitor validation loss to determine when to stop training.  
- **Loss curves**: If loss is decreasing very slowly, the learning rate might be too low. If plateauing, consider changing the architecture (e.g., wide ResNet for image tasks).  
- **Overfitting/Underfitting**: A model with high accuracy but even higher loss might be overfitting (but 5 epochs reduces this risk).

### **Sample Mutation Set for Next Iteration**
```json
{
  "mutation_type": "additive",
  "parameters": {
    "learning_rate": 0.002,
    "batch_size": 32,
    "optimizer": "AdamW",
    "hidden_units": 512,
    "activation_function": "GELU",
    "epochs": 15,
    "augmentations": "rotation_range=10"
  }
}
```

### **Analysis of Your Results**
- Starting accuracy of 47.95% suggests the model is likely stuck in a suboptimal solution.  
- Loss is mismatched with accuracy (check if you're using the right loss function for your task).  
- Training only a few epochs means the learning rate and optimizer choice are critical.  

If you share more details (e.g., the model type, dataset size, or whether this is binary/multiclass classification), I can tailor suggestions further. Focus on increasing **training duration** and **model capacity** first, then refine hyperparameters.
