    "llm_self_critique": "- **Algorithmically simplified stress tensor calculation**: Uses a simplified sinusoidal formulation for passive stress, failing to capture nonlinear anisotropic material behavior. Consider adopting more complex fiber-based constitutive models (e.g., Holzapfel-Gasser-Ogden).  \n- **Poor temporal coupling between hemodynamics and reorientation**: Hemodynamic parameters are only updated at cycle boundaries, while fiber reorientation occurs continuously. Both processes should be integrated within the same time discretization framework.  \n- **Fixed and rigid region assignments**: Random node regions assigned at initialization with no adaptive learning. Replace with learned or spatially structured initialization and allow material parameters to evolve dynamically (e.g., fibrosis progression).  \n- **Overly simplistic Windkessel implementation**: 1-component Windkessel lacks vascular dynamics. Use multi-component Windkessel or a pulse wave propagation model for better ventricular-vascular coupling.  \n- **Linear reorientation sensitivity parameter**: Uniform `kappa` value ignores regional variation. Introduce region-dependent kappa values (e.g., fibrosis regions have different sensitivities).  \n- **Arbitrary stress-to-angle conversion**: `_determine_principal_directions` uses an arctangent formula rather than properly calculating eigenvectors of the stress tensor. This introduces directional inaccuracies.  \n- **Unoptimized time integration**: Fixed 0.01s time step may be too large for stress-dynamics or too small for hemodynamics. Use adaptive time stepping or coupled ODE solvers for both subsystems.  \n- **No learning framework**: Model parameters are hard-coded and not adapted during simulation. Integrate gradient-driven optimization or meta-learning to calibrate parameters to target outputs.  \n- **Overly simplistic input flow waveform**: Sinusoidal input lacks physiological realism (e.g., asymmetric flow profiles). Use empirically derived or machine learningâ€“generated waveforms.  \n- **No spatial connectivity**: Nodes treated as independent entities without spatial adjacency. Incorporate spatial interaction terms (e.g., diffusion of stress) to enable realistic fiber alignment patterns.",
