    "llm_self_critique": "**Critique and Suggested Improvements**  \n- **Model Design**  \n  - **Feature Fusion Strategy**: Simple concatenation + MLP may fail to weight modality contributions effectively (e.g., depth/RGB features are fixed 512D, audio/haptic 128D/64D). Consider adaptive fusion like cross-attention or gate mechanisms (e.g., hypernetworks or LSTM-based multimodal integration).  \n  - **Haptic Encoder Capacity**: Two linear layers for haptic data might be insufficient. Expand depth (e.g., 3-4 layers) or use a residual structure to avoid information loss in low-dimensional inputs.  \n  - **ResNet Modifications**: First conv layer uses `kernel_size=7` for input H/W ≥ 224. If operating on lower-res inputs (e.g., 64x64), this could lose spatial context; validate input resolution requirements or adjust conv kernel/stride.  \n  - **Audio Encoder**: Shallow (3x `Conv2D + ReLU + MaxPool`) may underfit spectrogram patterns. Add temporal convolution (1D CNN) or transformer blocks to capture sequences in audio instead of fixed pooling.  \n\n- **Learning Strategy**  \n  - **Final Action Layer**: The single linear layer (`hidden_size` → `action_dim`) lacks nonlinearity. Add a task-specific head with activation functions (e.g., GELU) and smaller final layer width (e.g., `hidden_size // 2` → `action_dim`) to refine representations.  \n  - **Pretrained Encoders**: RGB and depth encoders are initialized randomly. Pretrain RGB encoder on ImageNet (or domain-specific data) and adapt depth encoder to correlate with RGB features (e.g., multi-task training).  \n  - **Modality Training Balance**: All modalities are fused equally, but loss values/accuracy suggest poor modality contribution. Use modality-specific losses (e.g., MAE for vision, spectral contrasts for audio) and associated task-based weights during training.  \n  - **Regularization**: Dropout is only in fusion MLP. Add spatial dropout in RGB/depth encoders or spectral normalization in audio layers to prevent overfitting in high-D features (especially with 1296D to 256D compression).  \n\n- **Data Flow and Handling**  \n  - **Input Consistency Checks**: Audio input assumes fixed `N_FRAMES=100` in code, but the arg parser lacks a `--audio-frames` parameter. Ensure all modalities are synchronized and adaptively processed (e.g., `AdaptiveAvgPool1d` for audio sequences).  \n  - **Heterogeneous Modality Interaction**: RGB, depth, and audio are processed as independent embeddings. Add cross-modal interactions (e.g., bilinear pooling, message passing between encoders) to better model joint latent relationships.  \n  - **Normalization Uniformity**: Audio and haptic inputs are not normalized. Implement separate input normalization layers (`LayerNorm`/batch-specific norms) per modality to stabilize training.  \n  - **Gradient Flow Between Modalities**: Depth encoder shares ResNet architecture but depth inputs may carry distinct patterns (e.g., scatter distribution in depth vs. RGB). Consider asymmetric architectures (e.g., lightweight net for depth) or pretrained depth-specific models.",
