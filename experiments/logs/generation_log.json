        "llm_self_critique": "- **Shape mismatch in attention layers**: The `fused_emb` is created by concatenating video and audio embeddings along `dim=1` (sequence length), but the audio encoder outputs 32 channels while video outputs 64 channels. The Transformer expects `d_model=64`, so audio embeddings need to be projected to match 64 dimensions before fusion to avoid invalid input shapes during attention computation.\n\n- **Inadequate advantage estimation**: The current advantage calculation `(values - all_rewards.mean())` uses a global reward baseline, ignoring trajectory-specific value expectations. Replace with Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) or use the critic’s own output as a baseline for more consistent learning.\n\n- **Incorrect critic loss formulation**: The critic is trained using raw per-step rewards (`F.mse_loss(values, all_rewards)`), which fails to model the value function (expected cumulative return). Instead, compute the actual discounted returns for each state and train the critic to predict these, separating value and policy objectives properly.\n\n- **Lack of hyperparameter tuning for optimization**: The optimizer uses default arguments (e.g., no explicit `lr`), which may not align with optimal training dynamics for this architecture. Explicitly define learning rate, weight decay, and momentum to stabilize training.\n\n- **Ineffective cross-modal fusion**: Concatenation of video and audio streams (with `split_streams=True`) may not enable meaningful cross-attention due to heterogeneous spatial-temporal resolutions. Consider progressive cross-modal attention or modality-wise projection layers to align feature spaces before fusion.\n\n- **Insufficient exploration/exploitation mechanisms**: Using `Tanh` for action normalization restricts exploration without pairing with exploration bonuses. Add entropy regularization to the policy loss or incorporate action noise (e.g., Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process for continuous actions) to improve sample diversity.\n\n- **Output feature utilization in attention**: After reshaping, video embeddings (`16×64×64`) and audio embeddings (`<sequence_length>, 32`) are flattened into single vectors. Retain spatial-temporal dimensions (e.g., via 4D spatial attention in video) to preserve structure for better Transformer interaction.\n\n- **Suboptimal sequence alignment in attention**: The video (16 frames) and audio (200/64 ≈ 3.1 steps) have mismatched temporal lengths after pooling. Adjust pooling/strides to align `video_emb` and `audio_emb` sequence lengths for attention efficiency, or use unaligned attention mechanisms (e.g., multi-sequence attention).\n\n- **Poor evaluation metric feedback**: Reporting `final_actions.std()` as a proxy for performance is ambiguous. Track per-step policy entropy, cumulative predicted values, or align evaluation with domain-specific metrics (e.g., pouring accuracy in real-world examples).\n\n- **Untested environment-to-model input pipeline**: Assumptions about `sim_env.generate_video_frame(step)` (5D `video_state` input shapes) could conflict with encoder expectations. Verify input shapes for `video_encoder` and `audio_encoder` match (e.g., [batch, channels, T, H, W] for video and [batch, channels, T] for audio) during trajectory simulation.\n\n- **Missing gradient clipping in training**: Large gradients from the attention layers or high-dimensional inputs could destabilize training. Add `torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_` during backpropagation to prevent exploding gradients, especially with complex spatiotemporal models.\n\n- **Overly simplistic policy gradient implementation**: The loss `- (actions * advantages).mean()` assumes deterministic policy updates and lacks PPO-style clipping, trust region constraints, or ratio-based surrogate objectives. Consider migrating to standard PPO updates with clipping (at 0.1–0.2) for better policy optimization stability.\n\n- **Fixed temporal frame stacking length**: `config.max_frame_stack` is fixed during training. Adaptive frame aggregation (e.g., temporal convolution preceding the attention layer) or dynamic frame handling could improve robustness to varying task durations.",

Consider explicit cross-attention (e.g., a fixed query sequence being one modality attending to the other).  \n  - The Projection layer for audio (32 → *feature_dim*) is applied outside the model’s predefined forward pass, creating a potential inconsistency between training and inference. Ensure in-model projection for compatibility.  \n  - The video encoder’s final `AdaptiveAvgPool3d` may discard spatial-temporal hierarchies. Replace with global average pooling in spatial dimensions or add a ResNet-style trunk for better feature learning.  \n\n- **Learning Strategy**:  \n  - The critic loss targets (`all_rewards`) assume immediate rewards as ground truth, but actor-critic methods require estimated **expected returns** (e.g., GAE, TD targets) for effective value approximation.  \n  - Advantages are calculated by subtracting a static reward mean, which ignores temporal dependencies and introduces high variance. Use a baseline network or iterative value estimation instead.  \n  - Policy gradient is trained on raw action outputs (`actions * advantages`), but deterministic policies in PG require clipped or entropy-regularized actions to avoid overfitting. Add entropy bonus to encourage exploration.  \n  - No explicit action normalization is enforced during training, though `Tanh()` is used in the actor. Consider cosine similarity regularization of normalized features for better modality alignment.  \n\n- **Data Flow**:  \n  - The training loop samples only *one batch per epoch* (`indices = torch.randperm(...)[:batch_size]`), wasting most of the dataset. Replace with proper `DataLoader` sampling and iterate over all micro-batches per epoch.  \n  - During evaluation, the code conditionally applies a separate `cross_modal_attention()` function not used in training (conflicts with the model’s `attn_layers`). Ensure consistency between training and inference fusion strategies.  \n  - The video and audio branches process fixed temporal lengths (`max_frame_stack` and `T_audio`), but dynamic temporal padding/windowing (e.g., fixed-length via interpolation or sliding windows) could improve flexibility for real-world data.  \n  - No mention of domain-shifting (`video_encoder`’s `GroupNorm`) or curriculum learning (easiest to hardest audio/visual conditions).  \n\n- **Architectural Extensions**:  \n  - Add positional encodings in the attention layers to retain temporal order when fusing video and audio features.  \n  - Consider channel-attention mixing between video and audio features (e.g., via Skip-Connections or Squeeze-and-Excitation) before transformer layers.  \n  - Augment the audio encoder with residual connections or deeper bottleneck layers to capture more complex acoustic patterns.  \n\n- **Other Issues**:  \n  - The `actor` and `critic` share the exact same input (post-attention features), which may overfit the critic to the immediate rewards instead of projecting action values. Use separate heads or skip connections for better differentiation.  \n  - DID NOT use modular structures for each modality’s feature encoding → may lead to conflicting learning objectives. Train encoders separately to convergence before joint training.  \n  - No dropout or stochasticity in feature extractors, increasing risk of overfitting multimodal invariants. Add stochastic layers (e.g., DropPath for 3D convolutions) in the forward pass.",

Cross-modal attention requires consistent temporal abstraction between modalities.  \n  - **Missing cross-modal attention definition**: The `cross_modal_attention` function in the evaluation loop is not implemented in the model, creating inconsistency between training and inference. Use the same attention layers defined in `attn_layers` for both.  \n  - **Hard-coded feature dimensions**: The audio projection to `feature_dim` assumes compatibility, but no mechanism ensures temporal alignment. Consider dynamic temporal resolution or interpolation to merge video/audio streams effectively.  \n\n- **Learning Strategy Critique**:  \n  - **Incorrect advantage calculation**: Subtracts a static reward mean as baseline instead of using a dynamic state-dependent baseline (e.g., GAE, TD errors). Critic updates should reflect true value gradients against discounted rewards.  \n  - **Policy gradient flaws**: Directly uses raw action outputs in loss (`actions * advantages`) instead of log-probabilities, which is the standard in policy gradient frameworks. Replace with a distribution-based output (e.g., Gaussian/Categorical) and compute weighted negative log-probs.  \n  - **Imbalanced actor-critic gradient scaling**: Combines policy and value loss with equal weights, which may dominate during training. Introduce separate scaling factors (e.g., `PPO`-style coefficients) or curriculum learning for better convergence.  \n  - **Replay mechanism missing**: Samples random batches in each epoch without iterating through the full dataset. Implement a proper data loader with full coverage for offline learning or sequence-wise sampling for online methods.  \n\n- **Data Flow Critique**:  \n  - **Video input tensor inconsistency**: The model expects a 5D input `(batch, 3, T, H, W)`, but the `train_policy` function receives a 4D `all_states` tensor. Resolve this dimension mismatch by validating and restructuring training data.  \n  - **Incomplete feature fusion**: Concatenates video and audio features naively. Consider modality-specific architectures (e.g., dual-query cross-attention) or hierarchical fusion layers to better integrate different sequence lengths.  \n  - **Synthetic evaluation data misalignment**: The `sim_env.generate_complex_pouring_sequence()` outputs video/audio without confirming their temporal alignment with the model's expected sequence lengths (e.g., 16 frames for video vs. 125 audio samples). Standardize temporal sampling during evaluation.  \n\n- **Improvement Suggestions**:  \n  - **Add spatial compression** in video encoder (e.g., global average pooling over H/W to reduce dimensions to `(batch, T_source, feature_dim)` instead of `(T, 64, 64, 64)`).  \n  - **Adjust audio encoder** to output sequence lengths matching the video (e.g., interpolate or restrict frame stacking to align with audio sampling rates).  \n  - **Implement distribution-based action outputs** (e.g., 2 Gaussian heads for continuous actions) and revise policy loss using log probabilities for better gradient signals.  \n  - **Replace reward mean baseline** with critic-estimated values for advantages, ensuring value loss is computed against discounted returns or Q-values.  \n  - **Use modality-specific normalization** (e.g., instance norm for domain adaptation in video/audio encoders).  \n  - **Add residual connections** in the 3D CNN and attention layers to improve gradient flow and feature reuse.  \n  - **Implement separate attention submodules** for intra-modal and cross-modal processing (e.g., self-attention on video/audio features followed by cross-attention).  \n  - **Check for gradient leakage** by detaching features during advantage computation and ensuring training data is shuffled per epoch.  \n  - **Enhance batch processing** with `DataLoader` to avoid manual random sampling and ensure proper data iteration.  \n  - **Log separate actor-critic metrics** (e.g., policy score, value error, entropy) for hyperparameter tuning and analysis.",

Consider adaptive fusion like cross-attention or gate mechanisms (e.g., hypernetworks or LSTM-based multimodal integration).  \n  - **Haptic Encoder Capacity**: Two linear layers for haptic data might be insufficient. Expand depth (e.g., 3-4 layers) or use a residual structure to avoid information loss in low-dimensional inputs.  \n  - **ResNet Modifications**: First conv layer uses `kernel_size=7` for input H/W ≥ 224.

Add temporal convolution (1D CNN) or transformer blocks to capture sequences in audio instead of fixed pooling.  \n\n- **Learning Strategy**  \n  - **Final Action Layer**: The single linear layer (`hidden_size` → `action_dim`) lacks nonlinearity. Add a task-specific head with activation functions (e.g., GELU) and smaller final layer width (e.g., `hidden_size // 2` → `action_dim`) to refine representations.  \n  - **Pretrained Encoders**: RGB and depth encoders are initialized randomly. Pretrain RGB encoder on ImageNet (or domain-specific data) and adapt depth encoder to correlate with RGB features (e.g., multi-task training).  \n  - **Modality Training Balance**: All modalities are fused equally, but loss values/accuracy suggest poor modality contribution. Use modality-specific losses (e.g., MAE for vision, spectral contrasts for audio) and associated task-based weights during training.  \n  - **Regularization**: Dropout is only in fusion MLP. Add spatial dropout in RGB/depth encoders or spectral normalization in audio layers to prevent overfitting in high-D features (especially with 1296D to 256D compression).  \n\n- **Data Flow and Handling**  \n  - **Input Consistency Checks**: Audio input assumes fixed `N_FRAMES=100` in code, but the arg parser lacks a `--audio-frames` parameter. Ensure all modalities are synchronized and adaptively processed (e.g., `AdaptiveAvgPool1d` for audio sequences).  \n  - **Heterogeneous Modality Interaction**: RGB, depth, and audio are processed as independent embeddings. Add cross-modal interactions (e.g., bilinear pooling, message passing between encoders) to better model joint latent relationships.  \n  - **Normalization Uniformity**: Audio and haptic inputs are not normalized. Implement separate input normalization layers (`LayerNorm`/batch-specific norms) per modality to stabilize training.  \n  - **Gradient Flow Between Modalities**: Depth encoder shares ResNet architecture but depth inputs may carry distinct patterns (e.g., scatter distribution in depth vs. RGB). Consider asymmetric architectures (e.g., lightweight net for depth) or pretrained depth-specific models.",

        "llm_self_critique": "Here’s a critique and list of improvements for the model code and results:\n\n### **Model Design**\n- **Unbalanced branches**: The visual branch (3 CNN layers, 32, 64, 128 filters) is significantly deeper/complex compared to the audio branch (16, 32, 64 filters). This may lead to visual modality dominating the fused features; consider increasing audio branch depth/filters to match feature importance.\n- **Redundant merged dense layers**: For each dense layer unit in `args.dense_layers`, two consecutive `Dense` layers are created. This redundancy increases parameters without meaningful architectural benefit. Simplify to one `Dense` layer per unit and use residual connections instead.\n- **Insufficient final bottleneck**: The merged backbone reduces to a 256-unit bottleneck for the final dense layers (e.g., `[256, 128]`), which may not retain enough information for the 6-dimensional output. Consider adding a final `GlobalAveragePooling` or `Dense(128)` layer before the action output.\n- **Lack of adaptive fusion**: The `concatenate` operation is static and does not adaptively weight modality-specific contributions. Implement cross-attention mechanisms, modality-specific gates (e.g., sigmoid gates), or transformer-based fusion to better align features.\n- **Action output activation mismatch**: The final `tanh` is suited for regression but the experiment tracks \"accuracy,\" suggesting a classification task. Clarify task type (regression vs. classification) and align activation/loss/metric (e.g., `softmax` + `CategoricalCrossentropy` for classification).\n\n---\n\n### **Learning Strategy**\n- **Low regularization in merged layers**: The visual/audio branches use L2 and dropout, but the merged layers lack these. Add `BatchNormalization` and `Dropout` after concatenation to stabilize training.\n- **Fixed, non-adaptive learning rate**: Use a learning rate scheduler (e.g., `ReduceLROnPlateau` or `CosineAnnealing`) instead of a static `1e-4`. The current rate may hinder convergence for large models.\n- **No task-specific initialization**: Ensure `HeUniform` is appropriate for all layers (e.g., CNN.ReLU pairs). Consider `GlorotNormal` for final dense layers where activations are `tanh`/`softmax`.\n\n---\n\n### **Data Flow**\n- **High-dimensional fused feature bottleneck**: Visual and audio branches flatten to 256 and 128 dimensions, leading to a 384-D merged input. For `dense_layers=[256, 128]`, this risks input-output mismatch and vanishing gradients. Use projection layers (e.g., `GlobalMaxPooling`) to reduce dimensionality before concatenation.\n- **Primitive audio processing**: The audio branch uses 2D convolutions on spectrogram-like inputs (128x64), but audio data (e.g., spectrograms) may benefit from 1D convolutions across time steps or dilated convolutions. Add 1D convolutions in audio branches for better temporal resolution.\n- **Input shape mismatch in PyTorch model**: The dummy input shape (`torch.zeros(1, *model.image_branch[-2:-1], ...`) references raw layer parameters instead of output shape. Fix via explicit calculation (e.g., using `x.size()` after dummy forward pass).\n- **Inconsistent preprocessing**: Ensure audio and visual inputs share consistent normalization (e.g., [0, 1] for all modalities). Mismatched ranges can destabilize feature fusion.\n\n---\n\n### **General Improvements**\n- **Check metric alignment**: Since `tanh` is used for outputs, \"accuracy\" is invalid for regression. Use R², RMSE, or task-specific metrics (e.g., success rate in Sim2Real).\n- **Use data augmentation**: Add augmentations for both modalities (e.g., random cropping, noise injection, tempo shifts) to improve generalization to the real world.\n- **Domain randomization**: For Sim2Real, incorporate domain randomization in synthetic data to align visual/audio distributions with real-world data.\n- **Add pre-trained backbones**: Use pre-trained CNNs (e.g., MobileNet for vision) and pre-trained audio models (e.g., OpenL3) to improve feature extraction. Verify input sizes match backbone requirements.",

        "llm_self_critique": "- **Model Design Flaws**  \n  - The `StepHintTrainer` uses `CrossEntropyLoss` with `policy_states` (input IDs) as both inputs and labels during training, which reinforces generic language modeling objectives rather than step-hint alignment.  \n  - The `generate_step_mask` method for masking future tokens is implemented but the masking logic is not integrated into the forward pass, leading to potential incorrect attention patterns.  \n  - Missing implementation of `calculate_kl_divergence` in the base `PreTrainedModel` implies KL regularization is incomplete/unused despite being referenced in the optimizer step.  \n  - The two `train_step` methods (one in `StepHintTrainer`, another in a subclass) create ambiguity in the training loop and may conflict in implementation.  \n\n- **Learning Strategy Issues**  \n  - Rewards are computed using `reward_model(generated_texts)` but are not properly linked to the model’s logits via a policy gradient objective. The current loss only uses `reference_logits` (undefined function) and applies basic scaling, missing reward-weighted advantage gradients.  \n  - Clipping of negative advantages (`clip_neg_adv`) is defined but not applied consistently (e.g., no clipping in `_compute_advantages` and unclear connection to training steps).  \n  - `_sample_step_partition` uses simple token-length constraints but lacks alignment with the step-hint structure, potentially leading to arbitrary or uninformative step divisions.  \n\n- **Data Flow and Preprocessing Problems**  \n  - `tokenized_steps` in the dataset is precomputed during initialization and not dynamically adjusted during training, which could limit adaptability to varying batch/data properties.  \n  - Padding logic in `generate_step_mask` only pads to immediate step sizes but does not ensure all steps are pooled under a consistent sequence length, risking mismatched attention masks.  \n  - The `min_length` parameter filters step hints dynamically but may discard valid but shorter hints, reducing training data diversity.  \n\n- **Implementation-Level Optimizations**  \n  - Redundant tokenization calls in `_sample_step_partition` during training (e.g., `tokenizer.encode(hint, ...)` per step). Pre-tokenization should occur once in dataset initialization for efficiency.  \n  - `Tensor` types in `_compute_advantages` are inconsistently stacked (e.g., `rewards_tensor` from `List[Tensor]`), which can cause device/mode mismatches (e.g., `requires_grad` errors).  \n  - `reference_logits` is referenced but not defined in the dataset or trainer logic, leaving the KL regularization path incomplete.  \n\n- **Suggested Improvements**  \n  - Replace the loss function with a **reward-weighted log-prob loss** using policy gradient principles (e.g., `policy_log_probs * rewards` instead of static `CrossEntropyLoss`).  \n  - Integrate step-hint sequences directly into the model’s input (e.g., concatenate step prompts to the input text) and use a **sequence-level loss** (e.g., log-prob of step hints) instead of self-supervised input cloning.  \n  - Implement a **compatible model subclass** with `calculate_kl_divergence` to align with policy gradient expectations and ensure KL regularization is effective.  \n  - Enhance `_sample_step_partition` to use **dynamic position-dependent split points** (e.g., semantic boundaries or task-specific markers) instead of heuristic length checks.  \n  - Adjust `min_length` with a **task-agnostic test** to validate minimum required step depth, or use a sliding window to repurpose partial steps.  \n  - Pre-tokenize all step hints during dataset creation to avoid redundant tokenization in training loops and ensure consistency.  \n  - Use **advantage clipping** logic in `_compute_advantages` to limit negative advantage values based on `clip_neg_adv` for stable training.  \n  - Add a curriculum learning scheduler for `step_level`, starting with fewer steps and gradually increasing complexity to improve gradient stability.  \n  - Validate reward model integration by ensuring the returned rewards are in the correct format (e.g., detached tensors on the correct device).",

        "llm_self_critique": "- **Model Design Critique**:  \n  -orghed **Three separate models** (`knowledge_generator`, `reverse_step_generator`, `step_predictor`) may lead to over-parametrization and inconsistent knowledge transfer. Consider shared architecture or parameter tying for better coherence.  \n  - **Unused components** (`step_predictor`, `knowledge_evaluator`): The step predictor and evaluator are included in the architecture but not used in the forward pass or training loss. This creates redundant complexity without contributing to learning.  \n  - **Reverse sequence loss misalignment**: The reverse generator uses `step_ids` as labels while being fed a reversed sequence. The reversed labels should match the reversed input structure (e.g., reconstruct reversed steps or verify the final answer).  \n\n- **Learning Strategy Critique**:  \n  - **Teacher forcing dependency**: The forward pass relies on ground-truth `step_ids` for training, but the reverse loss uses partially known `step_ids` from the same data. This limits the model's ability to correct hallucinations during unrolled generation.  \n  - **Undifferentiated temperature usage**: Temperature is applied only to the knowledge generator, but reverse and evaluation components lack this, potentially leading to imbalanced gradient flow.  \n  - **Lambda reverse weighting**: The reverse loss coefficient (`lambda_reverse=0.3`) may not be optimal. The model underperforms (47% accuracy), suggesting reverse loss is too dominant or not driving meaningful constraint.  \n\n- **Data Flow Critique**:  \n  - **Token padding strategy**: Left-padding may dilute problem-text importance in the forward pass. Right-padding would align with standard PLMs and preserve input semantics.  \n  - **Reverse sequence truncation**: Reverse sequences use `max_seq_length * 2` as the limit, but no mechanism handles cases where reversed reasoning + answer exceeds this. This could truncate critical consistency checks.  \n  - **Special token redundancy**: Special tokens (`[STOP_HINT]`, `[REVERSED_SEQUENCE]`, `[ANSWER_SEPARATOR]`) are added but not encoded consistently. Ensure tokenizer special tokens are explicitly mapped to unique IDs and used in training.  \n\n**Suggested Improvements**:  \n- **Unify forward and reverse models**: Use a single shared backbone (e.g., T5) for both reasoning and reverse verification to improve consistency and reduce parameter count.  \n- **Connect step predictor to output**: Integrate the step predictor's hidden outputs into knowledge evaluation (e.g., as attention weights over generated steps) to enforce step-level reasoning.  \n- **Correct reverse loss labels**: Align reverse loss targets with the actual reversed structure (e.g., reconstruct the original problem from reversed steps + answer, or use reversed step labels).  \n- **Adjust padding/truncation logic**: Use right-padding and implement dynamic truncation for middle steps to prevent important tokens from being cut.  \n- **Add evaluation loss term**: Compute a loss to train `knowledge_evaluator` to validate step correctness or the final answer separately (e.g., binary classification head).  \n- **Refactor temperature application**: Use temperature for reverse sequence generation during training to encourage diverse yet constrained outputs.  \n- **Debug gradient flow**: Ensure all model parameters (including `step_predictor` and `knowledge_evaluator`) are contributing to the final loss gradient via backward calls.  \n- **Improve data masking**: Modify attention masks to explicitly exclude padding tokens and enforce correct position-wise attention for recurrent step processing.  \n- **Balance lambda_reverse with dynamic scaling**: Experiment with adaptive loss weighting (e.g., curriculum learning) instead of a fixed reverse loss coefficient.  \n- **Enhance validation during data loading**: Add explicit validation for step-answer consistency in `_load_data()` to avoid corrupted examples affecting training.",

Consider adopting more complex fiber-based constitutive models (e.g., Holzapfel-Gasser-Ogden).  \n- **Poor temporal coupling between hemodynamics and reorientation**: Hemodynamic parameters are only updated at cycle boundaries, while fiber reorientation occurs continuously. Both processes should be integrated within the same time discretization framework.  \n- **Fixed and rigid region assignments**: Random node regions assigned at initialization with no adaptive learning.
