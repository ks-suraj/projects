        "llm_self_critique": "- **Shape mismatch in attention layers**: The `fused_emb` is created by concatenating video and audio embeddings along `dim=1` (sequence length), but the audio encoder outputs 32 channels while video outputs 64 channels. The Transformer expects `d_model=64`, so audio embeddings need to be projected to match 64 dimensions before fusion to avoid invalid input shapes during attention computation.\n\n- **Inadequate advantage estimation**: The current advantage calculation `(values - all_rewards.mean())` uses a global reward baseline, ignoring trajectory-specific value expectations. Replace with Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) or use the critic’s own output as a baseline for more consistent learning.\n\n- **Incorrect critic loss formulation**: The critic is trained using raw per-step rewards (`F.mse_loss(values, all_rewards)`), which fails to model the value function (expected cumulative return). Instead, compute the actual discounted returns for each state and train the critic to predict these, separating value and policy objectives properly.\n\n- **Lack of hyperparameter tuning for optimization**: The optimizer uses default arguments (e.g., no explicit `lr`), which may not align with optimal training dynamics for this architecture. Explicitly define learning rate, weight decay, and momentum to stabilize training.\n\n- **Ineffective cross-modal fusion**: Concatenation of video and audio streams (with `split_streams=True`) may not enable meaningful cross-attention due to heterogeneous spatial-temporal resolutions. Consider progressive cross-modal attention or modality-wise projection layers to align feature spaces before fusion.\n\n- **Insufficient exploration/exploitation mechanisms**: Using `Tanh` for action normalization restricts exploration without pairing with exploration bonuses. Add entropy regularization to the policy loss or incorporate action noise (e.g., Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process for continuous actions) to improve sample diversity.\n\n- **Output feature utilization in attention**: After reshaping, video embeddings (`16×64×64`) and audio embeddings (`<sequence_length>, 32`) are flattened into single vectors. Retain spatial-temporal dimensions (e.g., via 4D spatial attention in video) to preserve structure for better Transformer interaction.\n\n- **Suboptimal sequence alignment in attention**: The video (16 frames) and audio (200/64 ≈ 3.1 steps) have mismatched temporal lengths after pooling. Adjust pooling/strides to align `video_emb` and `audio_emb` sequence lengths for attention efficiency, or use unaligned attention mechanisms (e.g., multi-sequence attention).\n\n- **Poor evaluation metric feedback**: Reporting `final_actions.std()` as a proxy for performance is ambiguous. Track per-step policy entropy, cumulative predicted values, or align evaluation with domain-specific metrics (e.g., pouring accuracy in real-world examples).\n\n- **Untested environment-to-model input pipeline**: Assumptions about `sim_env.generate_video_frame(step)` (5D `video_state` input shapes) could conflict with encoder expectations. Verify input shapes for `video_encoder` and `audio_encoder` match (e.g., [batch, channels, T, H, W] for video and [batch, channels, T] for audio) during trajectory simulation.\n\n- **Missing gradient clipping in training**: Large gradients from the attention layers or high-dimensional inputs could destabilize training. Add `torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_` during backpropagation to prevent exploding gradients, especially with complex spatiotemporal models.\n\n- **Overly simplistic policy gradient implementation**: The loss `- (actions * advantages).mean()` assumes deterministic policy updates and lacks PPO-style clipping, trust region constraints, or ratio-based surrogate objectives. Consider migrating to standard PPO updates with clipping (at 0.1–0.2) for better policy optimization stability.\n\n- **Fixed temporal frame stacking length**: `config.max_frame_stack` is fixed during training. Adaptive frame aggregation (e.g., temporal convolution preceding the attention layer) or dynamic frame handling could improve robustness to varying task durations.",

Consider explicit cross-attention (e.g., a fixed query sequence being one modality attending to the other).  \n  - The Projection layer for audio (32 → *feature_dim*) is applied outside the model’s predefined forward pass, creating a potential inconsistency between training and inference. Ensure in-model projection for compatibility.  \n  - The video encoder’s final `AdaptiveAvgPool3d` may discard spatial-temporal hierarchies. Replace with global average pooling in spatial dimensions or add a ResNet-style trunk for better feature learning.  \n\n- **Learning Strategy**:  \n  - The critic loss targets (`all_rewards`) assume immediate rewards as ground truth, but actor-critic methods require estimated **expected returns** (e.g., GAE, TD targets) for effective value approximation.  \n  - Advantages are calculated by subtracting a static reward mean, which ignores temporal dependencies and introduces high variance. Use a baseline network or iterative value estimation instead.  \n  - Policy gradient is trained on raw action outputs (`actions * advantages`), but deterministic policies in PG require clipped or entropy-regularized actions to avoid overfitting. Add entropy bonus to encourage exploration.  \n  - No explicit action normalization is enforced during training, though `Tanh()` is used in the actor. Consider cosine similarity regularization of normalized features for better modality alignment.  \n\n- **Data Flow**:  \n  - The training loop samples only *one batch per epoch* (`indices = torch.randperm(...)[:batch_size]`), wasting most of the dataset. Replace with proper `DataLoader` sampling and iterate over all micro-batches per epoch.  \n  - During evaluation, the code conditionally applies a separate `cross_modal_attention()` function not used in training (conflicts with the model’s `attn_layers`). Ensure consistency between training and inference fusion strategies.  \n  - The video and audio branches process fixed temporal lengths (`max_frame_stack` and `T_audio`), but dynamic temporal padding/windowing (e.g., fixed-length via interpolation or sliding windows) could improve flexibility for real-world data.  \n  - No mention of domain-shifting (`video_encoder`’s `GroupNorm`) or curriculum learning (easiest to hardest audio/visual conditions).  \n\n- **Architectural Extensions**:  \n  - Add positional encodings in the attention layers to retain temporal order when fusing video and audio features.  \n  - Consider channel-attention mixing between video and audio features (e.g., via Skip-Connections or Squeeze-and-Excitation) before transformer layers.  \n  - Augment the audio encoder with residual connections or deeper bottleneck layers to capture more complex acoustic patterns.  \n\n- **Other Issues**:  \n  - The `actor` and `critic` share the exact same input (post-attention features), which may overfit the critic to the immediate rewards instead of projecting action values. Use separate heads or skip connections for better differentiation.  \n  - DID NOT use modular structures for each modality’s feature encoding → may lead to conflicting learning objectives. Train encoders separately to convergence before joint training.  \n  - No dropout or stochasticity in feature extractors, increasing risk of overfitting multimodal invariants. Add stochastic layers (e.g., DropPath for 3D convolutions) in the forward pass.",

Cross-modal attention requires consistent temporal abstraction between modalities.  \n  - **Missing cross-modal attention definition**: The `cross_modal_attention` function in the evaluation loop is not implemented in the model, creating inconsistency between training and inference. Use the same attention layers defined in `attn_layers` for both.  \n  - **Hard-coded feature dimensions**: The audio projection to `feature_dim` assumes compatibility, but no mechanism ensures temporal alignment. Consider dynamic temporal resolution or interpolation to merge video/audio streams effectively.  \n\n- **Learning Strategy Critique**:  \n  - **Incorrect advantage calculation**: Subtracts a static reward mean as baseline instead of using a dynamic state-dependent baseline (e.g., GAE, TD errors). Critic updates should reflect true value gradients against discounted rewards.  \n  - **Policy gradient flaws**: Directly uses raw action outputs in loss (`actions * advantages`) instead of log-probabilities, which is the standard in policy gradient frameworks. Replace with a distribution-based output (e.g., Gaussian/Categorical) and compute weighted negative log-probs.  \n  - **Imbalanced actor-critic gradient scaling**: Combines policy and value loss with equal weights, which may dominate during training. Introduce separate scaling factors (e.g., `PPO`-style coefficients) or curriculum learning for better convergence.  \n  - **Replay mechanism missing**: Samples random batches in each epoch without iterating through the full dataset. Implement a proper data loader with full coverage for offline learning or sequence-wise sampling for online methods.  \n\n- **Data Flow Critique**:  \n  - **Video input tensor inconsistency**: The model expects a 5D input `(batch, 3, T, H, W)`, but the `train_policy` function receives a 4D `all_states` tensor. Resolve this dimension mismatch by validating and restructuring training data.  \n  - **Incomplete feature fusion**: Concatenates video and audio features naively. Consider modality-specific architectures (e.g., dual-query cross-attention) or hierarchical fusion layers to better integrate different sequence lengths.  \n  - **Synthetic evaluation data misalignment**: The `sim_env.generate_complex_pouring_sequence()` outputs video/audio without confirming their temporal alignment with the model's expected sequence lengths (e.g., 16 frames for video vs. 125 audio samples). Standardize temporal sampling during evaluation.  \n\n- **Improvement Suggestions**:  \n  - **Add spatial compression** in video encoder (e.g., global average pooling over H/W to reduce dimensions to `(batch, T_source, feature_dim)` instead of `(T, 64, 64, 64)`).  \n  - **Adjust audio encoder** to output sequence lengths matching the video (e.g., interpolate or restrict frame stacking to align with audio sampling rates).  \n  - **Implement distribution-based action outputs** (e.g., 2 Gaussian heads for continuous actions) and revise policy loss using log probabilities for better gradient signals.  \n  - **Replace reward mean baseline** with critic-estimated values for advantages, ensuring value loss is computed against discounted returns or Q-values.  \n  - **Use modality-specific normalization** (e.g., instance norm for domain adaptation in video/audio encoders).  \n  - **Add residual connections** in the 3D CNN and attention layers to improve gradient flow and feature reuse.  \n  - **Implement separate attention submodules** for intra-modal and cross-modal processing (e.g., self-attention on video/audio features followed by cross-attention).  \n  - **Check for gradient leakage** by detaching features during advantage computation and ensuring training data is shuffled per epoch.  \n  - **Enhance batch processing** with `DataLoader` to avoid manual random sampling and ensure proper data iteration.  \n  - **Log separate actor-critic metrics** (e.g., policy score, value error, entropy) for hyperparameter tuning and analysis.",

Consider adaptive fusion like cross-attention or gate mechanisms (e.g., hypernetworks or LSTM-based multimodal integration).  \n  - **Haptic Encoder Capacity**: Two linear layers for haptic data might be insufficient. Expand depth (e.g., 3-4 layers) or use a residual structure to avoid information loss in low-dimensional inputs.  \n  - **ResNet Modifications**: First conv layer uses `kernel_size=7` for input H/W ≥ 224.

Add temporal convolution (1D CNN) or transformer blocks to capture sequences in audio instead of fixed pooling.  \n\n- **Learning Strategy**  \n  - **Final Action Layer**: The single linear layer (`hidden_size` → `action_dim`) lacks nonlinearity. Add a task-specific head with activation functions (e.g., GELU) and smaller final layer width (e.g., `hidden_size // 2` → `action_dim`) to refine representations.  \n  - **Pretrained Encoders**: RGB and depth encoders are initialized randomly. Pretrain RGB encoder on ImageNet (or domain-specific data) and adapt depth encoder to correlate with RGB features (e.g., multi-task training).  \n  - **Modality Training Balance**: All modalities are fused equally, but loss values/accuracy suggest poor modality contribution. Use modality-specific losses (e.g., MAE for vision, spectral contrasts for audio) and associated task-based weights during training.  \n  - **Regularization**: Dropout is only in fusion MLP. Add spatial dropout in RGB/depth encoders or spectral normalization in audio layers to prevent overfitting in high-D features (especially with 1296D to 256D compression).  \n\n- **Data Flow and Handling**  \n  - **Input Consistency Checks**: Audio input assumes fixed `N_FRAMES=100` in code, but the arg parser lacks a `--audio-frames` parameter. Ensure all modalities are synchronized and adaptively processed (e.g., `AdaptiveAvgPool1d` for audio sequences).  \n  - **Heterogeneous Modality Interaction**: RGB, depth, and audio are processed as independent embeddings. Add cross-modal interactions (e.g., bilinear pooling, message passing between encoders) to better model joint latent relationships.  \n  - **Normalization Uniformity**: Audio and haptic inputs are not normalized. Implement separate input normalization layers (`LayerNorm`/batch-specific norms) per modality to stabilize training.  \n  - **Gradient Flow Between Modalities**: Depth encoder shares ResNet architecture but depth inputs may carry distinct patterns (e.g., scatter distribution in depth vs. RGB). Consider asymmetric architectures (e.g., lightweight net for depth) or pretrained depth-specific models.",
