The study presents a multi-scale finite element model, MyoFE, to investigate fiber remodeling in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). The model examines the effects of hypercontractility, hypocontractility, and fibrosis on cardiac structure and function. Below is a structured overview of the key points, insights, and contributions of the research:

### **Key Findings**
1. **Fiber Disarray Patterns**:
   - **Regional Differences**: Fiber disarray is significantly higher near the epicardium compared to the endocardium across all perturbed cases, aligning with clinical DT-MRI findings. This is attributed to stress distribution gradients, with endocardial regions having stronger circumferential stress alignment.
   - **Perturbation-Specific Effects**: 
     - **Hypercontractility**: Minimal reorientation within perturbed regions; reorganization occurs in adjacent normal myocardium due to elevated contractile stress. 
     - **Hypocontractility/Fibrosis**: Pronounced disarray within perturbed regions due to passive stress dominance and loss of contractility, respectively.
   - **Severity Correlation**: Disarray correlates linearly with the severity of contractile dysfunction (e.g., 100%↑/↓ in *k1* increases disarray significantly).

2. **Mechanical Stress Effects**:
   - Heterogeneous perturbations disrupt stress distributions, leading to fragmented or elevated regions. 
   - Active stress dominates in hypercontractile areas, while passive stress drives disarray in hypocontractile/fibrotic regions.

3. **Cardiac Function Decline**:
   - **Hypercontractile**: Slight increase in ejection fraction (EF +3.5%) due to enhanced contractility, with minimal stroke volume (SV) change.
   - **Hypocontractile/Fibrosis**: Marked reductions in SV (16% and 22%, respectively) and EF (23% and 18%), alongside decreased systolic pressures. Fibrosis worsened transmural strain patterns, particularly radial and longitudinal strains.

4. **Distribution Independence**:
   - Disarray patterns are robust to perturbation distribution size (minimum cluster size 2−3 mm), suggesting mechanical interactions dominate over spatial placement.

### **Methodological Contributions**
- **Stress-Based Reorientation Law**:
  - Fibers reorient toward the local traction vector (from total stress) using:  
    \[
    \frac{df_0}{dt} = \frac{1}{\kappa} \left( \frac{Sf_0}{\|Sf_0\|} - f_0 \right)
    \]
  - Incorporates both *active* (from MyoSim) and *passive* stresses, enabling predictions for fibrotic regions without active contraction.

- **Integration of Multiscale Components**:
  - Combines calcium dynamics, sarcomere-level mechanics, finite element (FE) cardiac deformation, and a Windkessel circulation model for closed-loop hemodynamics.

- **Validation Against Literature**:
  - Stress-strain curves for fibrosis show doubled stiffness (via parameter adjustments), and baseline models match healthy hemodynamic benchmarks (EDV ~123 mL, EF ~56%).

### **Implications for HCM Pathophysiology**
- **Mechanical Stress-Remodeling Link**: Disarray arises from mechanical stress imbalances caused by heterogeneous contractility/matrix stiffness, not just gene mutations.
- **Role of Fibrosis**: Advanced fibrosis impairs both contraction and diastolic function, underscoring its clinical severity.
- **Therapeutic Targets**: Interventions targeting fibrosis progression or modulating stress distributions (e.g., via matrix reinforcement therapies) could reduce disarray.

### **Limitations and Future Work**
- **Model Simplifications**:
  - Idealized LV geometry; future steps require patient-specific geometries from imaging.
  - No explicit tissue growth modeling, though plans exist to incorporate growth laws.
  - Time constant *κ* remains uncalibrated to real-world timelines.
- **Biological Mechanisms**:
  - Fibrosis development is modeled mechanically but not biologically (e.g., fibroblast activity).
- **Parameter Calibration**:
  - Default parameters derived from literature; patient-specific tuning could improve accuracy.

### **Significance**
- Provides mechanistic insights into how cellular-level defects (contractility, fibrosis) propagate into disarray and impairment, guiding future therapeutic research.
- Validates computational modeling as a tool for studying HCM progression and testing interventions.

### **Key Figures and Insights**
- **Figure 6**: Highlighted disarray hotspots (e.g., hypercontractile regions pull adjacent fibers out of alignment).
- **Figure 10**: PV loops show hypo/fibrosis cases exhibit "inward" shifts (poor filling/ejection) vs. hyper’s leftward shift (hyperdynamic ejection).
- **Figure S2**: Fibrosis’s doubled stiffness explained via Guccione material parameters.

This work advances understanding of HCM’s mechanical mechanisms and offers a predictive framework for patient-specific disease modeling. Future validations with clinical or histological data could strengthen its translational impact.
