    "summary": "A hybrid evolutionary strategy (ES) and gradient-based optimizer for deep learning, combining large-scale exploration with efficient local refinement. Leverages adaptive mutation operators, entropy regularization for diversity preservation, and integrates gradient descent (Adam) for acceleration. Designed for scalability across CNNs, transformers, and RL agents, targeting robust optimization in noisy environments with reduced sample complexity.",
