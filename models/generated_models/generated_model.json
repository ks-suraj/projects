  "design": "**1. Textual Description of the Architecture (127 words):**  \nThe **Hybrid ConvoSelf-Attn Model** combines convolutional neural networks with a hierarchical self-attention mechanism for efficient image classification. It features a **multiscale convolutional stem** to extract low-level features (2\u00d72, 4\u00d74 filters), followed by a **stage-wise fusion** approach. Each stage alternates between a convolutional block (with residual connections and spatial downsampling) and a **local-to-global attention module**: the local branch applies attention within small spatial patches, while the global branch uses standard self-attention on the downsampled feature maps. A **dense feature aggregation layer** merges outputs from both branches to preserve fine-grained and contextual details. The model uses **position-encoding-free attention** via learnable token vectors and incorporates **depthwise separable convolutions** between stages to reduce computational cost. Final logits are generated by a fully connected head after global average pooling. This design balances CNN efficiency for local patterns with transformer flexibility for global relations, enabling performance on ImageNet with fewer parameters by leveraging spatial hierarchies and lightweight attention fusion.\n\n**2.
