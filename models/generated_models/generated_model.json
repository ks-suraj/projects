  "design": "1. **Architectural Description (149 words):**  \nProposed \"ScaleFusion Transformer\" integrates multi-scale convolutional feature extractors with dynamic cross-transformer modules for hierarchical image classification. Base layers use parallel, grouped convolutions (3\u00d73, 5\u00d75, 7\u00d77 kernels) to capture local spatial patterns at different receptive fields. Feature maps are concatenated and fed into a feed-forward neural network with adaptive instance normalization for contextual refinement. A cross-scale transformer encoder then uses spatial attention across feature hierarchies: local features agglomerate via depthwise convolutions to reduce token redundancy (64\u219232\u219216\u00d716 spatial dimensions), while global attention mechanisms (4\u00d74 multi-head attention) dynamically route dependencies between semantically distinct regions. Final output combines transformer attn. weights with residual connections from convolutional stages via a weighted summation module, preserving fine-grained details while emphasizing high-level context. The design balances efficiency with global reasoning by progressively amplifying attention scale during feature abstraction, achieving state-of-the-art ImageNet accuracy with fewer parameters than existing hybrid models.\n\n2. **Sample PyTorch Pseudocode:**  \n```python\nclass ScaleFusionTransformer(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        # Multi-scale convolution backbone\n        self.stem = nn.Sequential(\n            nn.Conv2d(3, 64, 3, stride=2),\n            nn.LayerNorm([64, 112, 112])\n        )\n        self.block1 = MultiScaleConvBlock(64, [3,5,7], groups=8)\n        self.block2 = FeedForward(nn=64, reduction=16)\n        \n        # Hierarchical attention\n        self(attn_patch_sizes=[16, 8, 4], emb_dims=[256, 512, 1024])\n        self.classifier = nn.Linear(1024, 1000)\n\n    def forward(self, x):\n        x = self.stem(x)\n        for block in [self.block1, self.block2]:\n            x = block(x)\n        x = cross_scale_attn(x, patch_sizes=self.attn_patch_sizes)\n        x = global_attention_fusion(x)\n        return self.classifier(x)\n\nclass MultiScaleConvBlock(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, in_channels, kernel_sizes, groups=1):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.convs = nn.ModuleList([\n            nn.Conv2d(in_channels, in_channels, ks, padding=ks//2, \n                     groups=groups, bias=False) for ks in kernel_sizes\n        ])\n        self.prob_linear = nn.Softmax(1)\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        features = [F.gelu(conv(x)) for conv in self.convs]\n        weights = self.prob_linear(torch.randn(x.size(0), len(self.convs)))  # pseudo dynamic weighting\n        return torch.stack(features, dim=1) @ weights.unsqueeze(-1).unsqueeze(-1)\n        self(attn_patch_sizes=[16, 8, 4], emb_dims=[256, 512, 1024])\n```"
