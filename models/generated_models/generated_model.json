  "summary": "\n    This is a sample paper summary discussing a novel convolutional transformer hybrid model for image classification,\n    which combines convolution layers with attention-based modules to improve accuracy and efficiency on the ImageNet benchmark.\n    ",
  "design": "1. **Architecture Description (Convolutional Attention Hierarchical Network - CAHN):**  \n   CAHN integrates convolutional local feature extraction with attention-based global modeling through a hierarchical, alternating block structure. The model begins with a CNN stem to extract low-level features. Subsequent stages alternately apply grouped-depthwise convolutions (for lightweight local feature refinement) and sparse attention modules (for global contextual reasoning). Each pair of convolution and attention blocks is connected via residual skip connections to preserve spatial and frequency coherence. For efficiency, the transformer layers use windowed self-attention with adaptive top-k sampling. Finally, a classification head combines hierarchical features via a hybrid CNN-transformer bridge. This design balances local-to-global learning while minimizing computational overhead through sparse operations.\n\n2. **PyTorch Pseudocode:**\n```python\nclass LocalGlobalBlock(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, dim, num_heads, window_size=7):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.local_cnn = nn.Conv2d(dim, dim, kernel_size=3, groups=dim//8)\n        self.local_attn = WindowAttention(dim, window_size, num_heads)\n        self.global_attn = SparseSelfAttention(dim, num_heads, topk=20)\n        self.norm1 = nn.LayerNorm(dim)\n        self.norm2 = nn.LayerNorm(dim)\n        self.mlp = nn.Sequential(nn.Linear(dim, dim*4), nn.GELU(), nn.Linear(dim*4, dim))\n\n    def forward(self, x):\n        x = self.local_cnn(x) + x  # Residual conv\n        x = x.permute(0, 2, 3, 1)  # (B, C, H, W) -> (B, H, W, C)\n        x = self.norm1(x) + self.local_attn(x)\n        x = self.norm2(x) + self.global_attn(x)\n        x = self.mlp(x) + x\n        return x.permute(0, 3, 1, 2)  # Back to (B, C, H, W)\n\nclass CAHN(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, in_channels=3, num_classes=1000, stages=4, dim=128):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.stem = nn.Conv2d(in_channels, dim, kernel_size=4, stride=4)\n        self.blocks = nn.Sequential(*[LocalGlobalBlock(dim) for _ in range(stages)])\n        self.up_proj = nn.ConvTranspose2d(dim, 512, kernel_size=4, stride=4)\n        self.cls_head = nn.Linear(512 * 7 * 7, num_classes)\n\n    def forward(self, x):\n        x = self.stem(x)\n        x = self.blocks(x)\n        x = self.up_proj(x)\n        x = x.flatten(start_dim=1)\n        return self.cls_head(x)\n```\n\n**Key Features:**  \n- Alternating local (CNN) and global (attention) blocks with skip connections.  \n- Windowed attention and adaptive top-k sparse transformers reduce operations.  \n- Residual connections maintain feature integrity between modalities.  \n- Upscaling projection reintroduces spatial resolution for final classification."
