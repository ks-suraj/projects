  "design": "**Textual Description (150 words):**  \nThe proposed Hybrid Attention Convolution Network (HyACoNet) integrates a hierarchical CNN backbone with a task-driven attention module to enable efficient local-global feature fusion for image classification. The CNN base consists of depthwise separable convolutions to reduce parameters, followed by stage-wise downsampling to extract multi-scale features. In each stage, a dynamic attention gate merges adjacent layer outputs, weighting local patterns and global context adaptively. The transformer-based attention module then processes the highest-resolution CNN features by flattening spatial tokens and applying multi-head cross-attention between RGB and depth channels (if available). Finally, the model applies dual path fusion\u2014early integration of shallow attention-enhanced features with late-stage global representations\u2014and uses a bottleneck linear layer for classification. This architecture achieves parameter efficiency via shared attention weights across stages and spatial prior learning via combinatorial attention in the transformer module, improving robustness on ImageNet-like datasets.\n\n**PyTorch-like Pseudocode:**  \n```python\nclass HyACoNet(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, input_channels=3, num_classes=1000, dim=512, heads=8):\n        super(HyACoNet, self).__init__()\n        # Hierarchical CNN backbone\n        self.base_cnn = nn.Sequential(\n            nn.Conv2d(input_channels, 64, kernel_size=7, stride=2),\n            nn.Sequential([ConvBlock(64, 64) for _ in range(2)], downsample=False),\n            nn.Sequential([ConvBlock(64, 128) for _ in range(2)], downsample=True),\n            nn.Sequential([ConvBlock(128, 256) for _ in range(3)], downsample=True)\n        )\n        \n        # Attention fusion module\n        self.channel_attention = DualChannelTransformer(dim, heads)\n        self.spatial_attention = SpatialPriorGate(256, dim)\n        \n        # Dual path integration\n        self.classifier = nn.Sequential(\n            nn.AdaptiveAvgPool2d(1),\n            Flatten(),\n            nn.Linear(256, num_classes)\n        )\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        # Stage 1: Local feature extraction\n        x1 = self.base_cnn[0](x)\n        x2 = self.base_cnn[1](x1)\n        x3 = self.base_cnn[2](x2)\n        \n        # Stage 2: Global attention transformation\n        x3_flattened = x3.view(x3.size(0), -1, x3.size(2), x3.size(3))\n        fused_features = self.spatial_attention(x3_flattened)\n        context = self.channel_attention(fused_features)\n        \n        # Stage 3: Dual path fusion for classification\n        return self.classifier(context)\n```\n\n**Key Components (Concepts from Paper):**  \n- `ConvBlock` includes depthwise convolutions with residual shortcuts  \n- `DualChannelTransformer` applies cross-attention between modality-specific tokens (e.g., RGB vs depth in 3D scenarios)  \n- `SpatialPriorGate` uses learnable shifting mechanisms to highlight informative regions from pyramid features  \n- Early-late fusion through hierarchical feature recombination  \n- Bottleneck classifier with flattening operations to retain spatial-semantic correlations"
