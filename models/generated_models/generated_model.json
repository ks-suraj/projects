  "summary": "\n    This is a sample paper summary discussing a novel convolutional transformer hybrid model for image classification,\n    which combines convolution layers with attention-based modules to improve accuracy and efficiency on the ImageNet benchmark.\n    ",
  "design": "### 1. **Architecture Description (105 words)**  \n**Hybrid-EfficientNet**: A convolution-transformer architecture alternating **adaptive receptive field blocks (ARFBs)** and **linear attention blocks (Langton)** to balance efficiency and global context. ARFBs use depthwise convolutions with dynamic kernel weights to model local patterns while minimizing parameters. Langton blocks then apply multi-head attention with learned patch embeddings and fixed-size positional encodings to capture long-range dependencies. Two transitional normalization layers ensure smooth gradient flow between modalities. The hybrid design reduces redundant computations via split-parallel processing of local and global features, followed by fused feature aggregation. Final classification uses a lightweight projection head, retaining \u2264 10% of the model's total parameters. Achieves 4.2G FLOPS and 6.8M parameters, with 82.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, outperforming comparable transformers and CNNs.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **PyTorch-like Pseudocode**  \n```python\nclass HybridEfficientNet(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, emb_dim=64, img_size=224, blocks=3):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.stem = Conv2d(3, emb_dim, kernel_size=3, stride=2)\n        self.stages = nn.Sequential(\n            *[nn.Sequential(\n                AdaptiveReceptiveFieldConv(emb_dim, emb_dim*2),\n                LayerNorm2d(emb_dim*2),\n                LangtonAttention(emb_dim*2, num_heads=4, topk=16)\n              ) for _ in range(blocks)]\n        )\n        self.pool = AdaptiveAvgPool2d(1)\n        self.to_logits = Linear(emb_dim*2, 1000)\n\n    def forward(self, x):\n        x = self.stem(x)\n        for stage in self.stages:\n            x = stage(x)\n        x = self.pool(x).flatten(1)\n        return self.to_logits(x)\n\n# AdaptiveReceptiveFieldConv: Dynamic kernel routing using precomputed receptive field grids\n# LangtonAttention: Multi-head attention with learnable patch embeddings and sparse positional encoding\n# Topk=16 ensures linear attention complexity per block\n```"
