    "title": "MultiGen: Using Multimodal Generation in Simulation to Learn Multimodal\n  Policies in Real",
    "summary": "Robots must integrate multiple sensory modalities to act effectively in the\nreal world. Yet, learning such multimodal policies at scale remains\nchallenging. Simulation offers a viable solution, but while vision has\nbenefited from high-fidelity simulators, other modalities (e.g. sound) can be\nnotoriously difficult to simulate. As a result, sim-to-real transfer has\nsucceeded primarily in vision-based tasks, with multimodal transfer still\nlargely unrealized. In this work, we tackle these challenges by introducing\nMultiGen, a framework that integrates large-scale generative models into\ntraditional physics simulators, enabling multisensory simulation. We showcase\nour framework on the dynamic task of robot pouring, which inherently relies on\nmultimodal feedback. By synthesizing realistic audio conditioned on simulation\nvideo, our method enables training on rich audiovisual trajectories -- without\nany real robot data. We demonstrate effective zero-shot transfer to real-world\npouring with novel containers and liquids, highlighting the potential of\ngenerative modeling to both simulate hard-to-model modalities and close the\nmultimodal sim-to-real gap.",

    "summary": "Dense 3D scene reconstruction from an ordered sequence or unordered image\ncollections is a critical step when bringing research in computer vision into\npractical scenarios. Following the paradigm introduced by DUSt3R, which unifies\nan image pair densely into a shared coordinate system, subsequent methods\nmaintain an implicit memory to achieve dense 3D reconstruction from more\nimages. However, such implicit memory is limited in capacity and may suffer\nfrom information loss of earlier frames. We propose Point3R, an online\nframework targeting dense streaming 3D reconstruction. To be specific, we\nmaintain an explicit spatial pointer memory directly associated with the 3D\nstructure of the current scene. Each pointer in this memory is assigned a\nspecific 3D position and aggregates scene information nearby in the global\ncoordinate system into a changing spatial feature. Information extracted from\nthe latest frame interacts explicitly with this pointer memory, enabling dense\nintegration of the current observation into the global coordinate system. We\ndesign a 3D hierarchical position embedding to promote this interaction and\ndesign a simple yet effective fusion mechanism to ensure that our pointer\nmemory is uniform and efficient.

Prevailing approaches often treat each set of frames\nindependently, failing to effectively capture the temporal dependencies and\nredundancies inherent in videos. To address this limitation, we introduce\nRefTok, a novel reference-based tokenization method capable of capturing\ncomplex temporal dynamics and contextual information. Our method encodes and\ndecodes sets of frames conditioned on an unquantized reference frame. When\ndecoded, RefTok preserves the continuity of motion and the appearance of\nobjects across frames. For example, RefTok retains facial details despite head\nmotion, reconstructs text correctly, preserves small patterns, and maintains\nthe legibility of handwriting from the context. Across 4 video datasets (K600,\nUCF-101, BAIR Robot Pushing, and DAVIS), RefTok significantly outperforms\ncurrent state-of-the-art tokenizers (Cosmos and MAGVIT) and improves all\nevaluated metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) by an average of 36.7% at the same or\nhigher compression ratios.

By explicitly leveraging an unquantized reference frame to condition the encoding and decoding of subsequent frames, RefTok effectively captures temporal dependencies, motion continuity, and object appearance over time. This approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art tokenizers, enabling higher video quality at similar or reduced computational costs.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Key Methodology/Approach**  \nRefTok introduces a **reference-based tokenization framework** with two core components:  \n- **Reference Frame Conditioning**:  \n  - A subset of frames is selected as unquantized reference frames during tokenization.  \n  - Other frames are encoded relative to these references, allowing the model to retain and propagate contextual information (e.g., motion, appearance details) across the video sequence.  \n- **Latent Space Preservation**:  \n  - The method ensures continuity of motion and appearance by reconstructing frames via a decoder that uses both the reference frame and discrete tokens representing delta changes.  \n  - Innovations include handling **high-resolution details** (e.g., facial features, text legibility) and preserving **small patterns** (e.g., handwriting) through contextual awareness.  \n\nThis approach contrasts with traditional frame-agnostic tokenizers (e.g., Cosmos, MAGVIT), which process each frame independently and fail to model temporal dynamics effectively.

    "title": "Answer Matching Outperforms Multiple Choice for Language Model\n  Evaluation",
    "summary": "Multiple choice benchmarks have long been the workhorse of language model\nevaluation because grading multiple choice is objective and easy to automate.\nHowever, we show multiple choice questions from popular benchmarks can often be\nanswered without even seeing the question. These shortcuts arise from a\nfundamental limitation of discriminative evaluation not shared by evaluations\nof the model's free-form, generative answers. Until recently, there appeared to\nbe no viable, scalable alternative to multiple choice--but, we show that this\nhas changed. We consider generative evaluation via what we call answer\nmatching: Give the candidate model the question without the options, have it\ngenerate a free-form response, then use a modern language model with the\nreference answer to determine if the response matches the reference. To compare\nthe validity of different evaluation strategies, we annotate MMLU-Pro and\nGPQA-Diamond to obtain human grading data, and measure the agreement of each\nevaluation approach. We find answer matching using recent models--even small\nones--achieves near-perfect agreement, in the range of inter-annotator\nagreement. In contrast, both multiple choice evaluation and using\nLLM-as-a-judge without reference answers aligns poorly with human grading.\nImproving evaluations via answer matching is not merely a conceptual concern:\nthe rankings of several models change significantly when evaluating their\nfree-form responses with answer matching. In light of these findings, we\ndiscuss how to move the evaluation ecosystem from multiple choice to answer\nmatching.",
