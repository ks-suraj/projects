Abstract : 
A significant hallmark of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is fiber disarray, which is associated 
with various cardiac events such as heart failure. Quantifying fiber disarray  remains critical for 
understanding the disease’s complex pathophysiology. This study investigates the role of heterogeneous 
HCM -induced cellular abnormalities in the development  of fiber disarray and their subsequent impact on 
cardiac pumping function. Fiber disarray is predicted  using a stress -based law to reorient myofibers and 
collagen within a multiscale finite element cardiac modeling framework, MyoFE. Specifically, the mode l is 
used to  quantif y the distinct impacts of heterogeneous distributions of hypercontractility, hyp ocontractility , 
and fibrosis on fiber disarray development and examines  their effect on  functional characteristics of the 
heart. Our results show that  heter ogenous cell level abnormalities highly disrupt the normal mechanics of 
myocardium and lead to significant fiber disarray.  The pattern of disarray varies depending on the specific 
perturbation, offering valuable insights into the progression of HCM . Despit e the random  distribution of 
perturbed regions within the cardiac muscle, significantly higher fiber disarray is observed near the 
epicardium compared to the endocardium across all perturbed  left ventricle ( LV) models. This regional 
difference in fiber dis array, irrespective of perturbation severity, aligns with previous DT -MRI studies, 
highlighting the role of regional myocardial mechanics in the development of fiber disarray. Furthermore, 
cardiac performance declined in the remodeled L Vs, particularly in those with fibrosis and 
hypocontractility. These findings provide important insights into the structural and functional 
consequences of HCM and offer a framework for future investigations into therapeutic interventions 
targeting cardiac remodeling .

1. Introduction  
 
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most prevalent inherited heart disease, affecting over 
1 in 200 individuals [1, 2] . It is a leading cause of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in you ng individuals and a 
common cause of heart failure in adults [3]. A hallmark feature specific to patients who die suddenly with 
HCM is extensive fiber disarray, which is thought to play a key role in the development of re -entrant 
ventricular arrhythmias leading to SCD  [4]. This  disorganization of myocardial fibers can be localized to 
specific regions of the left ventricle (LV) or spread throughout the entire LV  [5]. In addition to fiber 
disarray, HCM is also associated with other pathological features, including LV hypertrophy, altered 
myocardial contractility, and cardiac fibrosis. The emergence of  fiber disarray is often thought to be 
connected to contractile imbalance and heterogeneous myocardial stiffening due to fibrosis; however, the 
underlying mechanisms are still not fully understood.  
Several studies have proposed that contractile imbalance, resulting from heterogeneity in force 
generation among cardiomyocytes, may contribute to the development of fiber disarray in patients with 
HCM [6-11]. To date, over 1,000 causative mutations have been identified for HCM, predominantly within 
genes encoding sarcomeric proteins responsible for generating and regulating contraction, wit h 
approximately one -third of these mutations located in β -cardiac myosin  [12]. Experimental studies have 
shown  substantial differences in force generation between individual cardiomyocytes from HCM patients 
with mutations in β -myosin heavy chain (β -MyHC) even  at the same calcium concentration  [7, 9, 10] . It is 
assumed that unequal fractions of mutant and wild -type protein , from cell to cell , may underlie such 
contractile imbalance. While the prevailing trend  is that HCM mutations cause hypercontractility —linked to 
mutation -induced disruption of the super -relaxed state (SRX) of myosin heads [7, 13-16]—several studies 
have also reported reduced force generation in certain HCM mutations, leading to hypocontractility  [7, 14, 
17-19].  
Alongside contractile imbalance, myocardial fibrosis plays a critical role in HCM pathology. 
Increased myocardial fibrosis is maladaptive, as its accumulation is correlate d with impaired cardiac 
relaxation  and a higher risk of heart failure  [20]. Myocardial fibrosis  can be categorized into  the general 
subtypes of replacement fibrosis  and interstitial fibrosis. In HCM, the predominant type of myocardial 
fibrosis  is replacement fibrosis, and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) with cardiac  MRI is the reference 
standard for detect ing this type of fibrosis  [21-23]. The emergence  of replacement fibrosis in HCM is 
driven by the premature death of mutant myocytes and the expansion of the interstitial matrix . Factors 
such as compromised coronary flow due to  hypertrophy, micro vascular dysfunction, increased oxidative 
stress, and heightened metabolic demands from abnormal biophysical properties of mutant sarcomeres 
contribute to myocyte death and the formation of replacement fibrosis in HCM [20]. The expansion of the 
extracellular matrix in fibrotic areas causes local stiffening and makes the myocardium highly 
heterogeneous, disrupting its mechanics and altering the stress distribution, which is assumed to 
contribute to  further remodeling of myocardial fibers.  
The intricate mechanisms underlying cardiac pathophysiological conditions are difficult to 
evaluate in a clinical setting due to ethical and technical limitations  [24]. But, c omputational methods , 
particularly finite element (FE) modeling, offer a promising solution by overcoming these limitations and 
providing valuable insights into cardiac structure and function. A key aspect of these models is the 
effective estimation of the cardiac fiber confi guration. Many models rely on rule -based assignments of 
myofiber angles based on experimental data  [25-29], while others use warping and projection methods to 
integrate geometry -specific myofiber angles from diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTMRI)  
[30-32]. A machine learning based model, which was used to estimate myocardial stiffness, showed the 
importance of fiber orientation on capturing realistic global pumping function  [33]. Given the crucial role of 
fiber organization in cardiac function and the disruptions caused by pathological conditions, it is essential 
to use a model that is flexible in assigning the initial fiber configuration and can predict gradual fiber 
remodeling in  conditions like HCM.  
Kroon et al. (2009) developed a cardiac FE model that adapts  myofiber orientation to minimize 
shear strain, based on the assumption  that shear strain disrupts the extracellular matrix (ECM) and leads 
to permanent fiber reorientatio n [34]. Similarly, Washio et al. (2015) used an adaptive model to predict 
myofiber orientation in healthy hearts, based on two independent optimization parameters: (1) local 
muscle workload and (2) contractile load impulse. Both of these parameters were functions of "active" 
cardiac c ontraction, which limited their ability to reflect passive behavior, especially in fibrotic regions  [35]. 
Washio et al. (2020) later found that the impulse -based mechanism was more suitable for myofiber 
reorientati on [36]. Another study utilized an agent -based model to describe fibroblast -driven collagen 
remodeling, regulated by chemic al and mechanical cues. This cell -level model was then scaled up to a 
3D FE model of the LV, but was limited to simulating only the diastolic phase  [37]. Mendiola et al.  [38] 
used a combination of image -driven micromechanics and computational modeling to assess the effects of 
fiber orientation and fibrosis over time in a rat model of myocardial infarction.  Other studies have 
investigated stress -based laws for collagen remodeling in arterial tissue  [39, 40] . 
The current  study employs  a stress -based fiber remodeling algorithm that extends the  previous 
methods by incorporating both active and passive stress as fiber adaptation drivers. This allows for the 
simulation of remodeling throughout the entire cardiac cycle in both myofibers and the extracellular 
matrix. In this approach, fibers tend to reorient toward local traction vectors, which can be altered due to 
heterogenous mechanical properties . Unlike ea rlier HCM finite element modeling studies that examine 
fiber disarray as a model  input affecting cardiac performance  [5, 41, 42] , i.e. the disarray is assigned a 
priori, the current  research investigates the underlying mechanisms driving fiber reorientation and predicts 
subsequent myocardial disarray. In a prior study, we demonstrated the accuracy of a stress -based fiber 
reorientation  law in predicting both normal fiber configurations and pathological remodeling post 
myocardial infarction (MI)  [43]. The aim of the current study is to deepen our understanding of HCM 
progression by examining how heterogeneous hypercontractility, hypocontractility, and fibrosis influence 
myocardial remodeling an d cardiac function.  This is motivated by studies looking at the  established 
stages of HCM, where the disease may be self -sustaining beyond the effects of the mutant protein  
affecting contractility , with the diseased ECM  in fibrotic tissue potentially playing a significant role  [44]. By 
isolating the effects of these cell -level HCM -induced abnormalities, this study provides new insights into 
disease progression and may help the development of more targeted therapeutic strategies.  
2. Methods  
2.1 MyoFE framework  
The current study examines fiber remodeling and cardiac behavior related to  HCM using a 
modular multiscale FE framework known as MyoFE (Figure 1). The MyoFE framework combines  various 
aspects of cardiovascular function, including calcium dynamics , myofiber  contraction, and circulatory 
hemodynamics, within a closed -loop model of the LV and systemic circulation. Additionally, a fiber 
reorientation module is coupled with this central framework to predict the fiber configuration in both the 
normal LV and advers e remodeling caused by HCM. All model parameters are detailed in Table S1 of the 
Supplementary Material.  
Myofiber  contraction is implemented  using a molecular -level model called MyoSim  [12, 26] , which  
computes the  active stress generated by sarcomeres based on the deformation of  the myofibers and the 
calcium concentration. In this study, a pacing stimulus activates  a two -compartment model of calcium 
dynamics. The mechanical configuration of the myofibers, including  changes  in sarcomere length and 
total stress, is derived from the 3D FE model of the LV . To impose the hemodynamic boundary condition 
related  with the  volume of the  LV cavity , a Windkessel circulation model [45] is used. Essentially , the total 
stress state in the myocardium  of the 3D FE model ( i.e., passive and active stress) is balanced by the 
pressure in the LV cavity. The coupling of the FE model and circulatory model constrains the LV cavity 
volume  calculated by each model, via a Lagrange multiplier,  which  allows for the determination of the 
cavity pressure.  
 
 
Figure 1: MyoFE framework schematic. A: The fiber reorientation algorithm reorients fibers using the myocardial 
stress from the LV model (upper panel) in the central framework. In regions of heterogeneous mechanical properties, 
this can lead to localized remodeling of the fibers (lower panel). The updated fiber vectors are then passed to the 
central framework for the subsequent time step. The unit vector 𝒇𝟎 represents the initial direction of a fiber. 𝒇𝟎 
reorients toward the local traction vector 𝑺𝒇𝟎, where 𝑺 is the total stress tensor, e ncompassing both passive and 
active stresses. B: The central framework consists of the lumped parameter circulatory model and modules in the 
yellow boxes on the left. Detailed information for each module is provided in the text.  
2.2 Circulation model  
The FE model is joined  with a Windkessel model of the closed systemic circulation  to determine  
the hemodynamic boundary conditions within the LV cavity . This circulation model, which includes six 
compartments in addition to the left ventricle, is represente d by a set of resistance (R) and compliance  (C) 
parameters . In each compartment, the rate of change in blood volume is determined by the difference 
between the inflow and outflow of blood per unit time, as follow s: 
𝑑𝑉𝑎𝑜𝑟𝑡𝑎

𝑑𝑉𝐿𝑉
𝑑𝑡=𝑄𝑣𝑒𝑖𝑛𝑠  𝑡𝑜 𝐿𝑉−𝑄𝐿𝑉 𝑡𝑜 𝑎𝑜𝑟𝑡𝑎 . (1) 

According to Ohm’s law, the blood flow from one compartment to another is equal to the pressure 
gradient between adjacent compartments divided by the resistance between them:  
 
𝑄𝐿𝑉 𝑡𝑜 𝑎𝑜𝑟𝑡𝑎 ={𝑃𝐿𝑉−𝑃𝑎𝑜𝑟𝑡𝑎

𝑅𝐿𝑉𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑛 𝑃𝑣𝑒𝑖𝑛𝑠 ≥𝑃𝐿𝑉
0 𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑒 . (2) 
For all compartments except the LV, the blood pressure is determined by the difference between 
the instantaneous and slack volumes  divided by the compartment's compliance:  
𝑃𝑖(𝑡)=𝑉𝑖(𝑡)−𝑉𝑖,𝑠𝑙𝑎𝑐𝑘
𝐶𝑖 , (3) 
where V i(t), V i,slack and C i are the instantaneous blood volume, the slack volume, and the compliance of 
compartment i, respectively. For the LV, cavity pressure is determined via the FE model, using the LV 
cavity volume from equation (1)  as a boundary condition  as described below . 
2.3 Finite element formulation  
The LV mechanics in this study are solved using a FE model implemented with the open -source 
FE library FEniCS  [46]. An implicit backward Euler scheme with a fixed time step of 1 ms  is used for time 
integration. The displacement field is represented by quadratic interpolation  over the mesh , while linear 
interpolation is used to describe the hydrostatic pressure. The FE formulation governs  the LV mechanics 
based on the minimization of  the Lagrangian functional  as described  below:  
 
ℒ(𝒖,𝑝,𝑃𝐿𝑉,𝑐𝑥,𝑐𝑦,𝑐𝑧)=∫𝑊(𝒖)𝑑𝑉Ω0−∫𝑝(𝐽−1)𝑑𝑉Ω0−
𝑃𝐿𝑉(𝑉𝐿𝑉(𝒖)−𝑉𝐿𝑉)−𝑐𝑥∙∫𝑢𝑥𝑑𝑉Ω0−
𝑐𝑦∙∫𝑢𝑦𝑑𝑉Ω0−𝑐𝑧∙∫𝒛×𝒖𝑑𝑉Ω0      ,       (4)         
where u is the displacement field, W is the total strain energy, and p is a Lagrange multiplier that enforces 
incompressibility by constraining the Jacobian of the deformation gradient tensor to unity (J=1). The LV 
cavity volume VLV(u) is constrained via the Lagrange multiplier PLV according to the hemodynamic 
boundary condition from the circulatory model VLV. Lagrange multipliers cx and cy constrain rigid body 
translation in the x and y directions, respectively, and cz constrains rigid body rotation.  
Additionally, the relationship between the volume of the LV cavity and the displacement field is 
defined as : 
𝑉𝐿𝑉(𝒖)=∫ 𝑑𝑉Ω𝑘,𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑜=−1
3∫ 𝒙̅∙𝒏𝑑𝑎              Γ𝑘,𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑜, (5) 
 
where 𝛺k,endo denotes the volume enclosed by the endocardial surface 𝛤k,endo and the basal plane  at z = 0 
and n is the direction of the outward normal vector  to the surface . The position vector 𝒙̅ is relative to the 
origin of the global coordinate system.  
Taking the first variation of equation (4)  allows us to express the weak formulation of the 
mechanics problem as follows:  
𝛿ℒ(𝒖,𝑝,𝑃𝐿𝑉,𝑐𝑥,𝑐𝑦,𝑐𝑧)=∫𝑭𝑺:𝛁𝜹𝒖𝑑𝑉−∫(𝑝𝐽𝑭−𝑻:𝛁𝜹𝒖−𝛿𝑝(𝐽−1)𝑑𝑉−Ω0 Ω0
𝑃𝐿𝑉∫𝐽𝑭−𝑻:𝛁𝜹𝒖𝑑𝑉−Ω0𝛿𝑃𝐿𝑉(𝑉𝐿𝑉(𝒖)−𝑉𝐿𝑉)−𝛿𝑐𝑥∙∫𝑢𝑥𝑑𝑉−Ω0𝑐𝑥∙∫𝛿𝑢𝑥𝑑𝑉−Ω0
𝛿𝑐𝑦∙∫𝑢𝑦𝑑𝑉−Ω0𝑐𝑦∙∫𝛿𝑢𝑦𝑑𝑉−Ω0𝛿𝑐𝑧∙∫𝒛×𝒖𝑑𝑉Ω0−𝑐𝑧∙∫𝒛×𝜹𝒖𝑑𝑉Ω0=0 , (6) 
where F denotes the deformation gradient tensor, S is the 2nd Piola Kirchhoff stress te nsor, δu∈H1(Ω0), 
δp∈L2(Ω0), δP LV∈R, δc x∈R, δc y∈R, and δcz∈R are test functions corresponding to u, p, P LV, cx, cy, and cz, 
respectively. In addition , a Dirichlet boundary condition 𝒖∙𝒏|𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒 =0 is considered for the base of the LV, 
which enforces  in-plane  deformation. The pressure in the LV cavity, derived from the Lagrange multiplier  
PLV  is incorporated into circulatory equation (2), ensuring complete coupling between the 3D FE model 
and the circulatory model.  
2.4 Mechanics of cardiac muscle  
This study incorporates both the passive and active properties of the myocardium to model the 
mechanical behavior of the LV.  Accordingly , the 2nd Piola Kirchhoff stress tensor is additively 
decomposed into active ( Sa) and passive ( Sp) components:  
𝑺=𝑺𝒂+𝑺𝒑 . (7) 
To capture the force -dependent nature  of myofibers, it is essential to decompose the passive 
response into two distinct components: the myofiber component and the  remaining  bulk material. 
Furthermore, a passive component is incorporated to account for the incompressibility of the tissue . The 
passive stress tensor for each component is calculated by taking the deriv ative of the strain energy 
function with respect to the Green -Lagrange strain tensor  E:  
𝑺𝒑=𝑺𝒗𝒐𝒍+𝑺𝒃𝒖𝒍𝒌 +𝑺𝒎𝒚𝒐𝒇𝒊𝒃𝒆𝒓
=𝜕Ψ𝑣𝑜𝑙
𝜕𝑬+𝜕Ψ𝑏𝑢𝑙𝑘
𝜕𝑬+𝜕Ψ𝑚𝑦𝑜𝑓𝑖𝑏𝑒𝑟
𝜕𝑬    ,   (8) 
where the volumetric strain energy function is Ψ𝑣𝑜𝑙=−𝑝(𝐽−1), with a Lagrange multiplier p to enforce  
incompressibility exactly. The strain energy function of the bulk tissue, which reflects the distribution of 
collagen, elastin, and microvasculature, is  modeled as a transversely isotropic material using the 
Guccione constitutive law  [47]: 
Ψ𝑏𝑢𝑙𝑘 = 𝐶
2(𝑒𝑄−1)
𝑤𝑖𝑡ℎ 𝑄=𝑏𝑓𝑓𝐸𝑓𝑓2+𝑏𝑥𝑥(𝐸𝑠𝑠2+𝐸𝑛𝑛2+𝐸𝑠𝑛2+𝐸𝑛𝑠2)+𝑏𝑓𝑠(𝐸𝑓𝑠2+𝐸𝑠𝑓2+𝐸𝑓𝑛2+𝐸𝑛𝑓2)  ,  (9) 
where C, b ff, bxx, and bfs are passive material parameters for the bulk tissue. E represents the Green -
Lagrange strain tensor  defined with respect to  the fiber, sheet, and sheer -normal directions  (f, s, and n 
components ), respectively. Lastly, the myofiber strain energy function  is defined as : 
Ψ𝑚𝑦𝑜𝑓𝑖𝑏𝑒𝑟 ={𝐶1(𝑒𝐶2(𝛼−1)2)𝛼>1
0                       𝛼≤1  , (10) 
where  𝛼=√𝒇𝟎∙𝑪𝒇𝟎 is the stretch along the fiber direction, C=FTF is the right Cauchy -Green deformation 
tensor, 𝒇𝟎 is the referential fiber direction, and C1, C2 are material constants.  
The active stress component ( Sa) is calculated  using the MyoSim framework [12], which  models 
the mechanical properties of dynamically  coupled  myofilaments of a half sarcomere  at each integration 
point in the LV FE mesh . A schematic of the cross -bridge scheme is illustrated in Figure 2 [28]. To 
describe  the MyoSim methodology , we define the transition fluxes of the binding sites on the actin 
filaments,  Jon and Joff and then describe the transition fluxes for the myosin filaments, represented by  J1, 
J2, J3, and J4, which capture various states of the myosin heads  [26]. 
The binding sites on actin trans ition between an inactive state (N off), where no myosin heads can 
attach, and an active state ( Non). The binding sites that are active can be  categorized into two 
configurations: Nunbound , representing sites that are not bound to myosin heads, and N bound, representing 
sites that are bound  to myosin heads and cannot transition  back to the Noff state . Jon is the flux that 
governs the transition of  binding sites from Noff to Non and is defined as: 
𝐽𝑜𝑛= 𝑘𝑜𝑛[𝐶𝑎2+](𝑁𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑙𝑎𝑝 − 𝑁𝑜𝑛)(1+𝑘𝑐𝑜𝑜𝑝 (𝑁𝑜𝑛
𝑁𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑙𝑎𝑝))   ,  (11) 
where Non represents the proportion of binding sites in the active state, kon denotes a rate constant,  
Noverlap  represents the proportion of binding sites in the vicinity of myosin heads, kcoop is a constant factor 
that controls the cooperativity of the thin filame nt. 
 
 
Figure 2: Cross -bridge scheme. Sites on the thin filament switch between states that are available (N on) and 
unavailable (N off) for cross -bridges to bind to. Myosin heads transition between a super -relaxed detached state 
(MSRX), a disordered -relaxed detached state (M DRX), and a single attached force -generating state (M FG). J terms 
indicate fluxes between different states. Reproduced with permission from Springer Nature from Sharifi et al  [28]. 
The activated unbound sites transition  back into the inactive state via the Joff flux, which is 
governed by a rate constant of koff: 
𝐽𝑜𝑓𝑓= 𝑘𝑜𝑓𝑓 (𝑁𝑜𝑛− 𝑁𝑏𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑 )(1+𝑘𝑐𝑜𝑜𝑝 (𝑁𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑙𝑎𝑝 − 𝑁𝑜𝑛
𝑁𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑙𝑎𝑝))   .               (12) 
On the myosin filament, myosin heads can switch  between three states: MSRX (detached super -
relaxed), MDRX (detached disordered -relaxed), and MFG (attached force generating). The fluxes governing 
the transitions between M SRX and M DRX are represented by J1 and J2, respectively  as below : 
𝐽1= 𝑘1 (1 + 𝑘𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑐𝑒 𝐹𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 )𝑀𝑆𝑅𝑋 .       (13)  
𝐽2 = 𝑘2𝑀𝐷𝑅𝑋 

In this equation, k1 and k2 are the rate constants, kforce is a parameter related to force -dependent 
recruitment  of myosin heads , Ftotal is the total stress (passive and active) along the myofiber , and MSRX 
and MDRX are the proportions of myosin heads in the SRX and DRX states.  Notably, since the HCM 
mutation s disrupt the SRX state, we implemented the abnormal contractility of the diseased LV by 
adjusting  k1. 
 
The attachment of myosin heads to binding sites is defined  by the transition flux J 3, while the 
detachment is governed by the transition flux J 4: 
                                            𝐽3 (𝑥)= 𝑘3𝑒−𝑘𝑐𝑏𝑥2
2𝑘𝐵𝑇(𝑁𝑜𝑛− 𝑁𝑏𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑 )𝑀𝐷𝑅𝑋                 ,               (14) 
𝐽4 (𝑥)=(𝑘4,0+𝑘4,1𝑥4) 𝑀𝐹𝐺(𝑥) 
where k3 and k4,0 are rate constants, kcb is the stiffness of the cross -bridge link, kB is the Boltzmann constant, 
T is temperature in Kelvin, k4,1 is the strain dependent cross -bridge detachment rate parameter, MFG is the 
proportion of myosin heads in the attached state, and x is the cross -bridge length.  
By utilizing the transition fluxes mentioned above, a system of ordinary differential equations  
(ODEs) is created to determine the proportion of  myosin head s and binding site s in each configuration.  
This system of ODEs is partitioned with a spatial resolution of 1 nm, spanning a range of −10≤𝑥≤10 
nm (i.e., n=21).  As a result, a total of 25 ODEs are solved at each integration point within the LV mesh, 
defined as : 
𝑑𝑁𝑜𝑓𝑓
𝑑𝑡 = −𝐽𝑜𝑛 + 𝐽𝑜𝑓𝑓
𝑑𝑁𝑜𝑛
𝑑𝑡 = 𝐽𝑜𝑛 − 𝐽𝑜𝑓𝑓
𝑑𝑀𝑆𝑅𝑋
𝑑𝑡 = − 𝐽1+ 𝐽2
𝑑𝑀𝐷𝑅𝑋
𝑑𝑡 = (𝐽1+ ∑ 𝐽4,𝑥𝑖𝑛
𝑖=1 ) − (𝐽2+ ∑ 𝐽3,𝑥𝑖𝑛
𝑖=1 )
𝑑𝑀𝐹𝐺,𝑖
𝑑𝑡 =  𝐽3,𝑥𝑖− 𝐽4,𝑥𝑖 𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 𝑖 = 1...𝑛             .          (15) 
The active stress experienced along  each myofiber can be determined by using  the proportion of 
myosin heads in the force -generating state, expressed as: 
 
𝐹𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒  = 𝑁𝑜𝑘𝑐𝑏∑ 𝑀𝐹𝐺,𝑖𝑛
𝑖=1  (𝑥𝑖+ 𝑥𝑝𝑠)            ,                     (16) 
                   
where N0 represents the density of myosin heads [48], and xps refers to the power stroke of an attached 
cross -bridge.  
Finally, the active stress tensor is defined by projecting Factive  along the myofiber direction:  
𝑺𝒂=𝐹𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 𝒇𝟎⨂𝒇𝟎      .                                        (17) 
 
2.5 Stress -Based  Fiber Reorientation  
The fiber reorientation mechanism  is depicted in Figure 3, where  𝒇𝟎 represents the unit vector 
along the fiber direction in the reference configuration, which is shared by  the myofibers and perimysial 
collagen fibers.  The traction vector ( 𝑺𝒇𝟎) is associated with the cross -sectional face of the fibers at a point 
in the L V. The stress -based reorientation law incrementally reorients the fibers at each integration point in 
the LV mesh, aligning them with the local traction vector as below:  
                                                      𝑑𝒇𝟎
𝑑𝑡=1
𝜅(𝑺𝒇𝟎
‖𝑺𝒇𝟎‖−𝒇𝟎)                            ,                (22) 
where 𝜅 is a time constant used to enforce the separation of time scales , which acts like a map between 
model time and real time. This is a numerical necessity to speed up the calculation of remodeling . 
Specifically, it facilitates a reasonable rate of fiber reorientation, enabling the capture of case -specific fiber 
configurations within a limited number of cardiac beats, which  leads to better  computationally efficiency . 
The gradual reorientat ion process minimizes the difference between the fiber direction and the direction 
of the traction experienced by the fibers. To capture the reorientation occurring in both myofibers and 
collagen, it is necessary  to use the total stress tensor, which inclu des both active and passive stress 
components.  This is especially important in the fibrotic  region s where the scar tissue is devoid of 
contracting myofibers.  For more details on the stress -based fiber reorientation law, please refer to our 
previous paper  [43].

collagen. 𝒇𝟎 reorients toward the local traction vector 𝑺𝒇𝟎, which is associated with the cross -sectional face of the

2.6 LV model geometry  
The LV of a human heart was modeled using an ellipsoidal geometry consisting of ~1250 
quadratic tetrahedral elements (refer to Supplementary Figure S 1 for the mesh sensitivity analysis). The 
LV's unloaded  chamber volume was 75 mL, with a length from base to apex of 7 .3 cm. At the base, the 
outer diameter was 7. 2 cm, and the wall thickness was about  1.3 cm , while the apical wall thickness was 
half of tha t value  [25]. The initial helical fiber angle was defined using a Laplace -Dirichlet rule -based 
algorithm, varying linearly from 60° at the endocardium to -60° at the epicardium transmurally across the 
wall's thickness [49]. The initial transverse angle was set to zero.   

2.7 Simulation cases and protocol  
To investigate the distinct effects of cell -level abnormalities induced by HCM, we developed a 
baseline LV model, as well as hypercontractile, hypocontractile, and fibrotic models. Previous studies 
have shown that mutant myocytes undergo biophysical damage , leading to myocyte death and focal 
scarring (replacement fibrosis)  [20]. Therefore, we hypothesized that the  myocardial  regions exhibiting 
abnormal contractility are the sa me regions  that progress to fibrosis  and assume  that these regions are 
similarly distributed in all perturbed models . We utilized the results from histological studies of fibrotic 
tissue  to prepare our fibrous model and applied the same  distribution pattern to the hypercontractile and 
hypocontractile models , as shown in Figure 4A. This assumption enables a direct comparison of how 
each type of abnormality affects the simulation results . Our assumption regarding the distribution of 
perturbed regions  in the models is also inspired by T2* images, which show patterns of regional abnormal 
contractility in HCM patients. Myocardial T2* is commonly regarded as a surrogate for myocardial tissue 
oxyg enation and is associated with myocardial contraction  [50]. 
According to measurements by Galati et al., we incorporated heterogeneous perturbed tissue 
consisting of 30% of the LV myocardium  in all of the disease d LV models  [21]. Notably, based on 
histological studies, fibrosis in HCM is almost evenly distributed among the epicardium, endocardium, and 
midwall layer  [21]. Therefore, we did not assign  any regional preferences, and the perturbed cells were 
randomly distributed within the myocardium of the LV.  
To determine whether variations in the distribution and size of perturbed regions influence the 
severity and pattern of fiber disarray, we modeled all cases using two additional different distributions of 
perturbed cells. According to prior histological studies, collagen scars of uninterrupted fibrosis , 
characterized by local foci greater than 2 mm , are classified as replacement fibrosis  [21]. Accordingly, we 
investigated three different sets of models with pert urbed regions of minimum sizes: 3 mm for Distribution 
1 (original distribution), 2.5 mm for Distribution 2, and 2 mm for Distribution 3  as shown in Figure 4 B.

All result figures in this paper are based on Distribution 1, and other distributions are investigated in Section 3.7.  
Baseline  
A baseline simulation was developed using par ameters that are representative of a healthy adult, 
with cardiac performance characteristics aligned with values reported in the literature  [52, 53] . The total 
blood volume was set to 4.5 liters, the end -diastolic volume (EDV) was 123 ml, the end -systolic volume 

(ESV) was 54 ml, and the ejection fraction (EF) of the LV was approximately 56% with a heart rate of 66 
beats per minute. Alongside the baseline LV model representing a healthy case, we prepared perturbed 
LV models as described below:  
Hypercontractile  
Cons idering the disruption of the SRX state of myosin heads in HCM patients, which modulates 
myocardial  contraction  [7, 12] , we incorporated a 100% increase in t he k1 value for perturbed cells in the 
hypercontractile models, where k1 represents the transition rate of SRX to DRX in the MyoSim contraction 
model. Subsequently, we investigated the sensitivity to k1 values by testing models with increased values 
of 20% , 60%, and 100%.  
Hypocontractile  
For the hypocontractile models , k1 is reduced with a similar percentage  to the hypercontractile 
models  in the affected  cardiomyocytes with impaired contractility.  
Fibrous  
To model the effects of heterogeneous replacement fibrosis in the LV, perturbed  myocar dial 
regions  are assigned with a 2-fold increase  in stiffness, as well as being isotropic  [44]. We utilized the 
stress -strain relation for biaxial loading within the physiological strain range (~15%) to identify the 
corresponding material parameters reflecting the increase in stiffness  (see Supplementary Material Figure 
S2). The  material properties of the fibrotic regions, incorporating both passive and active mechanical 
responses, were applied based on the parameters listed in Table 1.

Protocol  
The adaptation time constant , 𝜅, is set to 4 000 ms (Supplementary Material). The cardiac cycle 
time is assigned to be 937 ms (mimicking 6 4 bpm), with a numerical integration time step of 1 ms.  
Therefore, during each simulation time step, a 2.5x10-4 (dt/𝜅) fraction of the difference between the 
traction vector and fiber vector is used to update the fiber direction. All models ran for 200 second s (211 
cardiac cycles) to ensure  convergence  (cardi ac function reached a steady state , as shown in  the 
pressure -volume ( PV) loops  in Supplementary Material Figure S3) and results are reported for the last 
cardiac cycle . The simulation protocol for all the LV models  were developed with the following steps: (1)  
the initial fiber configuration was assigned to the LV using a rule -based approach, as described in Section  
2.6, then (2) the system reached hemodynamic steady state by simulating the first five second s without 
perm itting fiber reorientation, finally (3) fiber reorientation was simulated over the remaining  simulation 
time (195 s)  to obtain the case -specific fiber configuration.  
 
2.8 Implementation and Computer Code  
The MyoFE  source code was developed in Python utilizing widely used libraries such as Numpy  
[54], Scipy [55], and pandas  [56]. All simulations in this research were run on the Lipscomb Compute 
Cluster (LCC), a high -performance computing system at the University of Kentucky.  The required time for 
simulating one cardiac cycle using a single  node containing 32 cores was about  15 minutes. In this study, 
model parameters were not calibrated with specific experimental data; instead, the default parameters 
listed in Supplementary Material Table S1 were c hosen based on prior studies  and exper ience , ensuring 
the model replicates  typical healthy human characteristics  [45]. 
2.9 Code Availability  
The MyoFE code is maintained in a github  repository. The code will be made available to other 
researchers upon request to the corresponding author.  
3. Results  
3.1. Comparison of Stress State  
To explore the behavior of all models leading to fiber remodeling, we beg an by examining stress 
distributions, which serve as the driver of our fiber reorientation  algorithm. As shown in Figure 5, the 
baseline model exhibit s smooth  stress distribution s across  the endocardial surface and epicardial surface, 
with a decreasing transmural gradient from endo to epi, as well as variations from base to apex. This 
trend is seen in  the LV during both peak systole and diastole. In contrast, all perturbed models display ed 
highly heterogeneous stress distributions. In Figure 5A, the hypercontractile model shows  regions of  
elevated systolic stress, relative to baseline, while the hypocontractile and fibrous models exhibit a mix of 
elevated and  suppressed active stress  relative to baseline . Figure 5B reveals a different pattern for peak 
diastolic stress: the hypocontractile model demonstrates increased passive stress on the endocardial 
side, relative to baseline, which is most likely induced by an increase in end -diastolic vo lume (to be 
discussed in a later section).  However,  no such elevation is seen in the hypercontractile model and the 
fibrous model shows a reduction in stress. A similar, though milder, pattern is observed on the epicardial 
side.

3.2. Comparison of fiber reorientation   
 
This section evaluates the severity of fiber reorientation in each model and identifies the patterns 
of fiber disarray induced by each underlying perturbation . Figure 6 shows the magnitude of  the 3D angle 
between  the initial and reoriented fibers using the  dot product of their direction vectors. In the baseline 
model, this value remains low and uniform, whereas in all perturbed models, fiber reorientation is 
significantly heterogeneous, indicating substantial fiber disarray.  
On the epicardial surface (Figure 6A), the highest degree of fiber reorientation is observed in the 
fibrous model, slightly exceeding that of the hyp er- and hyp ocontractile models . The magnified view of 
Figure 6A further emphasizes the regional severity an d unique patterns of fiber disarray induced by each 
perturbation . In the hypercontractile model, fibers within the perturbed region show minimal reorientation, 
whereas the adjacent normal myocardium experiences severe reorientation. In contrast, both 
hypoc ontractile and fibrous models exhibit pronounced fiber reorientation within the perturbed region, 
accompanied by milder reorientation in the surrounding normal myocardium. This level of disarray, with 
fibers nearly orthogonal to each other, is consistent w ith previously reported findings in the literature for 
HCM (Figure 6B) . On the endocardial surface (Figure 6.C), comparable patterns of fiber disarray are 
observed , with more pronounced fiber reorientation in the hypocontractile and fibrous models compared  
to the hypercontractile model.  These results collectively demonstrate the distinct spatial patterns and 
severity of fiber disarray associated with each  perturbation type, providing mechanistic insights into the 
development of myocardial fiber disarray in HCM . Additional visual representations of the fiber disarray 
for each case can be found in Supp lementar y Figure  S4.

3.3. Comparison of Fiber Disarray  
As a quantitative measure of fiber disarray , the angular deviation (AD) of the helical and 
transverse  angles were  analyzed as shown in Figure 7. AD is defined as the regional standard deviation 
within the  epicardial layer and endocardial layer , each  with a  thickness of 20% of the transmural 
thickness . The baseline model exhibit s relatively low AD, indicating minor variations  in fiber orientations 
within the epicardial and endocardial layers. In all perturbed cases, helical AD (Figure 7A) show s a 
substantial  increase in the epicardium, with a comparatively smaller rise in the endocardium . In the 
endocardium, the hypocontractile model exhibited the highest helical AD, followed by the hypercontractile 
and fibrous models. Similarly, transverse AD also  increased across all perturbed models  (Figure 7B) , with 
higher values observed in the epicardium compared to the endocardium. Notably, within the 
endocardium, the hyper contractile model displayed the highest transverse AD, while the fibrous model 
showed t he greatest value in the epicardial layer.

angular deviation. B: Transverse angular deviation  
3.4. Contractile Sensitivity of Disarray  
In this section, we investigate how the severity of abnormal contractility influences the degree of 
fiber disarray. For hyp ercontractility, we developed separate models with k1 increa se of 20%, 60%, and 
100%  from the baseline LV model value  (k1 = 3.7 ). Similarly, we created hyp ocontractile models with 
corresponding k1 reduced  by the same percentages. Notably , we assigned the distributions of perturbed 
cells to be the same across all models.  010203040

In all cases, we observed an almost linear trend between the induced fiber disarray (AD) and the 
k1 parameter , as shown in Figure 8 . Notably, all models demonstrated that fiber disarray is more 
pronounced near the epicardium compared to the endocardium. Ne ar the epicardium, the 
hypercontractile and hyp ocontractile models exhibited similar sensitivity to changes in the k1 parameter. 
However, near the endocardium, the hypocontractile model displayed a more sizable  increase in disarray 
with altered  k1 values compared to the hypercontractile model.

hypocontractile LV models with 20%, 60%, and 100% changes in the k1 parameter. In hypocontractil e models, k1 is 
reduced compared to the baseline, while in hypercontractile models, k1 is increased.  
 
3.5. Comparison of systolic strain pattern  
The heterogenous cell -level perturbations, along with the resultant remodeled fiber 
configurations, had an  influence  on cardiac behavior.  As illustrated in Figure 9, notable regional 
differences emerged in the  systolic  strain patterns of the perturbed models compared to the baseline.  In 
the hypocontractile and fibrous models, systolic longitudinal strain exhibited a reduction specifically within 
the perturbed regions. Conversely, the hypercontractile model showed an overall increase in longitudinal 
strain, although local decreases wer e also observed  in some regions . In terms of the systolic  
circumferential strain, the fibrous model exhibiting the greatest decline  in the perturbed regions , followed 
by the hypocontractile model. The hypercontractile model  exhibited some regional variation, but the 
overall level of circumferential strain was comparable to baseline . Systolic r adial strain displayed a 
transmural pattern across all cases, with variability in its alterations among the perturbed models. Notably,  010203040

the fibrous model demonstrated a substantial decrease in radial strain.  Overall, the fibrous model 
displayed the greatest decrease in all systolic strain components relative to baseline.

calculated by taking a multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient, such that the deformation gradient 
between end -diastole and end -systole could be used to calculate the Lagrangian strain relative to end -diastole. 
This is the standard approach used for reporting systolic strain  [58]. 

 
3.6. Comparison of pumping performance  
All perturbations influence the PV loop of the LV by altering its size and positi on (Figure 10) . In 
the hypercontractile model, there is a minimal change in stroke volume (SV) accompanied by a leftward 
shift in the PV loop, resulting in a 3.5% increase in EF. Conversely, in the hypocontractile  model, the PV 
loop shrinks and shifts to the right, leading to a 16% reduction in SV and a 23% decline in EF, along with 
a reduction in systolic pressure. In the fibrous model, the PV loop shrinks “inward” (i.e. ESV increases 
and EDV decreases) along with  a reduction in systolic pressure. In the fibrous model, SV decreases by 
22% and EF drops by 18%.

3.7. Comparison of spatial distribution  
To investigate the effects of spatial distribution on the induction of fiber disarray, we tested three 
sets of models with varying spatial distributions and sizes of perturbed region s (but all still affect  30% of 
the myocardium) . In these  models, the perturbed regions were progressively refined into smaller patches  
as showed in Figure 4 starting from Distribution  1 then further refined to Distribution 2, and finally to 
Distribution 3. Based on Figure 1 1, higher fiber disarray is observed near the epicardium compared to the 
endocardium in all perturbations. Near the epicardium, the highest variability was observed in the 
hypo contractile  model, with a Coefficient of Variation (CV) of 2.5 %. Meanwhile , near the endocardium, 
the greatest variability occurred in the hyper contractile  model, with a CV of 5.2%. However, it should be

noted that t hese relatively low CV values (both below 10%) suggest that the fiber disarray results are 
largely independent of the distribution of perturbed  cells.  Furthermore, additional analyses, where spatial 
distribution effects were evaluated without altering the size of the perturbed regions ( see Figure S5 in 
Supplementary Material ), confirmed the independence of fiber disarray from the distribution of perturbed 
cells.

4. Discussion:  
This study investigates  the development of fiber disarray in HCM and evaluates the cardiac 
performance of remodeled LVs.  By integrating a stress -based fiber reorientation algorithm into a 
multiscale FE model of the LV, we explored the role of different cellular abnormalities in the development  
of fiber disarray. Building on our previous work  [43], which demonstrated the utility  of the stress -based 
fiber remodeling law in predicting both normal fiber configuration s and pathological remodeling post 
myocardial infarction (MI), this study focused on how specific HCM -related abnormalities —
hypercontractility, hyp ocontractility , and fibrosis —lead to fiber disarray and altered cardiac function. The 
perturbed LV models developed appreciable fiber disarray, with distinct patterns depending on the type of 
abnormality , offering important  mechanistic  insights into HCM progression.   
The baseline model demonstrated smooth  distribution s of stress throughout the LV. However, in 
the perturbed cases, a significantly more heterogeneous stress distribution was observed, as shown  in 
Figure 5. In peak systole, the active myofiber stress was prim arily influenced by the contractile capacity of 
the myocardium , with the hypercontractile model showing regional increases in stress  within the 
perturbed region. However,  the hypocontractile and fibrotic models exhibited reduc ed stress  in the 
perturbed regions  with increased stress in some of the surrounding  myocardium  (Figure 5A) . This could 
be due to an increase in sarcomere length within the normal myocardium at end systole (as seen in the 010203040

systolic strain patterns in Figure 9), which  leads to increased active stress  [59]. In peak diastole, pass ive 
myofiber stress increased in the hypocontractile model (Figure 5B) due to increased end diastolic volume  
(i.e., the ventricle is more distended).  Similar to a thick -walled pressure vessel, there is a dominant  stress  
in the circumferential  direction during diastole , particularly near the endocardium. This led to the 
reorientation of  fibers toward the circumferential direction, as seen in Figure 6C, and contributed to the 
observed rise in myofiber stress. Although the fibro us model also showed increased fiber reorientation  
toward  the circumferential direction  in the endocardium , increased stiffness resulted in stress reduction in 
the perturbed regions (Figure 5B) . In contrast, the hypercontractile model exhibited a reduction in diastolic 
passive stress, due to reduced end diastolic  volume , and remodeling with limited reorientation toward the 
circumferential direction  on the endocardium  (remodeling was dominated by  contractile stress  along 
fibers rather tha n passive stress ).  
Interestingly, the case -specific heterogeneity in stress distribution resulted in distinct patterns of 
fiber disarray across the perturbed models. As illustrated in the magnified view of Figure 6A, fibers within 
hypercontractile regions exhibited minimal r eorientation, as expected, due to the dominant contractile 
stress aligned with the fiber direction. However, these hypercontractile fibers exerted excessive shear 
stress on the surrounding normal myocardial fibers, causing them to reorient.  In contrast, in  
hypocontractile and fibrous models, the normal myocardial fibers around the perturbed regions displayed 
minimal  reorientation due to the dominant passive and active stress in the fiber direction. However, in the 
hypocontractile and fibrous regions themsel ves, the lack of contractility, coupled with an absence of 
directional dominance in passive stress (particularly in fibrous regions), resulted in substantial fiber 
reorientation. In this case, the elevated stress in the surrounding normal myocardium induce d 
reorientation within the perturbed regions . 
Previous studies using DT -MRI have demonstrated that a reduction in fractional anisotropy (FA) 
is a reliable indicator of increased myocardial fiber disarray, with lower FA values often observed in 
fibrotic reg ions. However, not all regional cases of low FA in patients with HCM can be fully corelated with  
fibrosis alone  [4], suggesting that myocardial mechanics also play s a significant role i n the severity of  
fiber disarray. Our models support this conclusion. Despite not incorporating any spatial preference within 
the myocardium when assigning perturbed regions, the angular deviation (AD) analysis (Figure 7) reveals 
significantly higher fiber  disarray in the epicardium. This finding can be attributed to the circumferential 
stress (hoop stress) induced within the LV wall  during loading , which has the largest magnitude  near the 
endocardium and diminishes toward the epicardium. As a result, the endocardium experiences a 
dominant stress direction that aligns fibers more uniformly, reducing directional randomness and disarray.  
These results highlight the significant impact  of mechanical stress distribution s within the myocardium on 
fiber organization. To further investigate the relationship between impaired contractility and fiber disarray, 
we examined the effect of varying degrees of contractile dysfunction on fiber disarr ay. A  nearly  linear 
relationship was observed between fiber disarray (AD) and the k1 parameter (Figure 8) . This  confirm s the 
previously mentioned observation about the differences in disarray between the epicardium and 
endocardium, regardless of the severity of contractile imbalance . Lastly, to assess the influence of spatial 
distribution on our results, we modeled various spatial distributions and sizes of perturbed regions ( see 
Figure 4B , Figure 11, and Figure S4 ), while preserving the 30%  volume fraction of heterogeneity . Our 
findings indicate that fiber disarray is largely independent of the spatial distribution of pertu rbed cells.  
The systolic strain results shown in Figure 9 align closely with previous experimental studies on 
normal and diseased hearts. CMR feature tracking studies have reported  average values of strain using 
the AHA bullseye guidelines. In healthy adults, the  value of  longitudinal strain  is approximately -16%, 
circumferential strain  is around -20%, and radial strain is around 38% [60, 61] , all of which match well with 
the baseline model (Figure 9A) that mimics normal cardiac function. This baseline serves as a reference 
for comparing the effects of different pathological conditions on myocardial strain.  The perturbed models  
(Figure 9B-D) exhibit significant alterations in deformation patterns . The reduction  in systolic strain  can be 
attributed to different mechanisms depending on the specific  cellular  abnormality . In the hypo contractile  
case, reduced longitudinal strain reflects a decrease in contractile capacity, while in the fibrous case, the 
reduction in strain is linked to both reduced contractility and impaired myocardial shortening caused by 
increased stiffness. Notably, the hyper contractile  case showed an increase in longitudinal strain in the 
unaffected (normal) myocardial regions.  When compared to experimental data, localized increases in 
longitudinal strain have been reported in early -stage HCM patients  [5], particularly in the non -obstructive 
form, which aligns with the behavior observed in our hyp ercontractile  model. However, in more advanced 
stages of HCM, as documented in several studies  [5, 60 -65], a marked reduction in longitudinal strain is 
observed, consistent with the results of our fibrous model  (Figure 9D). Circumferential strain followed a 
similar trend to longitu dinal strain, with  regional  reductions observed in all perturbed models. With regards 
to radial strain , the hypocontractile and hyper contractile  model s showed slight deviation s from the 
baseline case , with typical transmural gradients, while the fibrous model demonstrated a considerable 
reduction  (also observed in CMR studies  of HCM  [60]), indicating compromised function of the  
myocardium.  Overall, these results highlight the dominant role of fibrosis in altering myocardial strain 
patterns, particularly in its pronounced impact on longitudinal, circumferential, and radial strain.  
Cardiac pumping performance was altered in almost all perturb ed LV models, as demonstrated 
by substantial changes in the size and position of the PV loops compared to the baseline (Figure 10). In 
the hypercontractile model, SV remained relatively unchanged; however, the PV loop displayed a marked 
leftward shift (EDV  118 ml vs. 123 ml, ESV 48 ml vs. 54 ml) as reported for HCM patients [66, 67] , which 
was also accompanied by an increase in systolic pressure.  These  changes are primarily due to enhanced 
myocardial contractility. In contrast, in the hypocontractile model, the PV loop shrank and shifted 
rightward , along with a noticeable reduction in systolic pressure, which reflects the reduced contractile 
ability of the myocardium. The fibrous model followed a similar but more severe trend than the 
hypocontractile model, with further PV loop shrinkage, an “inwar d” shift (i.e. ESV increases and EDV 
decreases) , and a more pronounced decline in systolic pressure. This exacerbated deterioration in 
cardiac performance can be attributed to diminished contractile function , increased myocardial stiffness , 
and fiber disar ray, which not only impairs systolic ejection  but also diastolic filling. These observed PV 
loop behaviors , specifically in the hypocontractile and fibrous model s, are consistent with previous 
findings from PV catheterization studies in patients with established HCM  [66]. Overall, these results 
suggest that cell -level abnormalities, such as altered contractility and incre ased myocardial stiffness, 
result in significant  fiber remodeling and  impairments in cardiac pumping performance . 
 
4.1 Limitations  
 This study has some  limitations. First, the predictive capabilities of the MyoFE framework for fiber 
remodeling and resulting cardiac performance were assessed using idealized LV geometry . Future 
studies will incorporate more realistic geometries. Second, it should be noted that the current 
investigation did not consider volumetric growth, which typically occurs concurrently with HCM. This 
limitation will be addressed in future studies by incorporating a growth model into the modular framework  
and coupling it to the fiber rem odeling algorithm . Another limitation of the current model is that we did not 
tune the time constant κ in the reorientation law. This would require fitting to experimental data, which will 
be the focus of future studies.  Lastly, while we modeled fibrosis b y imposing the mechanical properties of 
fibrotic tissue, the underlying biological mechanism of fibrosis development was not implemented. 
Incorporating a predictive model that simulates the deposition of both diffuse fibrosis and localized 
replacement fibr osis as an adaptive immune response will be a focus of future research.  
 
5. Conclusion   
In conclusion, this study highlights the effectiveness of the multiscale cardiac modeling framework 
in predicting fiber remodeling within the LV. The results show that various heterogeneous perturbations in 
the LV models —including  hypercontracti lity, hypocontractil ity, and fibro sis—disrupt the normal stress 
distribution within  the LV muscle, leading to significant fiber remodeling. Each type of perturbation 
resulted in d istinct patterns of fiber disarray, which offer valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms 
of HCM disease progression. The cumulative impact of cellular -level abnormalities and the resulting fiber 
disarray  alter cardiac performance and functional cha racteristics, with unique patterns emerging for each 
perturbation. This comparative analysis provides a deeper understanding of structural and functional 
cardiac anomalies, potentially aiding in the identification of specific cellular -level causes linked t o cardiac 
dysfunction.
