This is achieved by decoupling the evolutionary process from costly retraining steps, instead leveraging direct model performance evaluation.  \n\n**Findings**: The proposed ES-driven optimization achieves competitive results with state-of-the-art NAS methods (e.g., NASNet, ENAS), highlighting its potential for practical applications where computational overhead is a concern.

        "design": "1. **Architectural Description (149 words):**  \nProposed \"ScaleFusion Transformer\" integrates multi-scale convolutional feature extractors with dynamic cross-transformer modules for hierarchical image classification. Base layers use parallel, grouped convolutions (3×3, 5×5, 7×7 kernels) to capture local spatial patterns at different receptive fields. Feature maps are concatenated and fed into a feed-forward neural network with adaptive instance normalization for contextual refinement. A cross-scale transformer encoder then uses spatial attention across feature hierarchies: local features agglomerate via depthwise convolutions to reduce token redundancy (64→32→16×16 spatial dimensions), while global attention mechanisms (4×4 multi-head attention) dynamically route dependencies between semantically distinct regions. Final output combines transformer attn. weights with residual connections from convolutional stages via a weighted summation module, preserving fine-grained details while emphasizing high-level context. The design balances efficiency with global reasoning by progressively amplifying attention scale during feature abstraction, achieving state-of-the-art ImageNet accuracy with fewer parameters than existing hybrid models.\n\n2. **Sample PyTorch Pseudocode:**  \n```python\nclass ScaleFusionTransformer(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        # Multi-scale convolution backbone\n        self.stem = nn.Sequential(\n            nn.Conv2d(3, 64, 3, stride=2),\n            nn.LayerNorm([64, 112, 112])\n        )\n        self.block1 = MultiScaleConvBlock(64, [3,5,7], groups=8)\n        self.block2 = FeedForward(nn=64, reduction=16)\n        \n        # Hierarchical attention\n        self(attn_patch_sizes=[16, 8, 4], emb_dims=[256, 512, 1024])\n        self.classifier = nn.Linear(1024, 1000)\n\n    def forward(self, x):\n        x = self.stem(x)\n        for block in [self.block1, self.block2]:\n            x = block(x)\n        x = cross_scale_attn(x, patch_sizes=self.attn_patch_sizes)\n        x = global_attention_fusion(x)\n        return self.classifier(x)\n\nclass MultiScaleConvBlock(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, in_channels, kernel_sizes, groups=1):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.convs = nn.ModuleList([\n            nn.Conv2d(in_channels, in_channels, ks, padding=ks//2, \n                     groups=groups, bias=False) for ks in kernel_sizes\n        ])\n        self.prob_linear = nn.Softmax(1)\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        features = [F.gelu(conv(x)) for conv in self.convs]\n        weights = self.prob_linear(torch.randn(x.size(0), len(self.convs)))  # pseudo dynamic weighting\n        return torch.stack(features, dim=1) @ weights.unsqueeze(-1).unsqueeze(-1)\n        self(attn_patch_sizes=[16, 8, 4], emb_dims=[256, 512, 1024])\n```"
